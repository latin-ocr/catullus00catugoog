CATULLUS.

[γι-3·

Aemulus iste tuus, qui uestrum exercet amorem,
Mirifice est a te nactus utrumque malum.
5 Nam quotiens futuit totiens ulciscitur ambos:
Illam adfligit odore, ipse perit podagra.

Dicebas quondam solum te nosse Catullum,
Lesbia, nec prae me uelle tenere Iouem.
Dilexi tum te non tantum ut uulgus amicam,
Sed pater ut gnatos diligit et generos.
5 Nunc te cognouit quare etsi impensius uror,

rem: if it be true that there are no
cases so early as this period of uester
for tuus, the meaning must be some·
what as follows: ‘your rival bas
usurped your place entirely, and now
himself enjoys all that love shared
mutually by you and your mistress
(uestrum) before she was cor-
rupted) But the passage is at
best unsatisfactory. With exercet
amorem cf. 61. 235 exercete iuuen-
tam; 68. 66 exerceremus ferrieres.
4. a te nactus: ie. in succeeding
to your place in the aflectibus of
your mistress he has also succeeded
to your diseases, and thereby brings
upon himself and her the punish·
ment due to false friend and faith-

though diligere sometimes has the
same meaning as amare, as in 6. 5 ;
