CATULLUS.

Puella nam mi, quae meo sinu fugit,
Amata tantum quantum amabitur nulla,
Pro qua mihi sunt magna bella pugnata,
Consedit istic. Hanc boni beatique
Omnes amatis, et quidem, quod indignum est,
Omnes pusilli et semitarii moechi:
Tu praeter omnes une de capillatis,
Cuniculosae Celtiberiae fili,
Egnati, opaca quem bonum facit barba

20 Et dens Hibera defricatus urina.
