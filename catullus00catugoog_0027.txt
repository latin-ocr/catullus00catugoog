him suddenly thither from Rome. For a time this emotion
dulled his sensibility to every other. He could think of noth-
ing else. He soreswore the Muses sorever, save to express the¹

burden of his woe (cc. 68. 19 3 65. 12). To the request ol the
influential orator Hortensius lor verses, he could send only a
translation from Callimachus, and the story ol his tears. He

, must even deny (c. 68⁰) an appeal from his friend Manlius sor

consolation on the death ol his wile, - perhaps the same Man-

written an exquisite marriage-song (c. 61). And even when
Manlius sought to recall him to Rome by hints concerning the
scandal aroused by Lesbia‘s misdoings, the only answer wasa
sigh (c. 68. 30).

renewed. Yet he has sor her words ol sorrow rather than ol
scorn. Even now, as formerly (c. 104), he cannot malign her,
although she has sunk so deep in degradation. In a simple,
manly way he declares the fidelity os his love for her (c. 87),
and the condition to which he has now been brought by her
fault and not his own (c. 75). However difficult it be to asso·
ciate the idea ol pure affection with a passion like his, there
is, nevertheless‚ an appeal ol trnth in his solemn asseveration

at this moment ol bitterest grief that his love for Lesbia was
not merely the passion of any common man sor his paid mis-
tress, but was as the love ol a father lor his son (c. 7²)· Not
