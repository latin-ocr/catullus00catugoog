the tastes and inclinations os Catullus as the father ol Horace
had with those os his son. Catullus, moreover, was not the
only son, and was probably younger than the one whose un·
timely death in the Troad he records.

ιο. Yet there was apparently wealth enough in the family to
enable even the younger brother to enjoy the advantages that
wealth brought to the young Italian of that day. He was able
early in his young manhood to go to Rome, aud to make that
city thencelorth his abiding-place (c. 68. 34 fl). He owned a
villa at Sirmio (c. 31), and another on the edge os the Sabine
hills (c. 44). And there is no indication that while at Rome he
was busy with any pursuit that could fill his purse, although,
like many another young Roman, he later obtained a provincial
appointment, and went to Bithynia on the staff ol the governor
Memmius in the hope os wealth (cf. ς ²9 ff.). The hope, he
tells us (cc. 10, 28), proved abortive, but Catullus had yet
money enough-perhaps even to purchase a yacht sor his
homeward joumeylike any millionnaire (cs. ἓ 35 and intro-
ductory note to c. 4) —at any rate to continue his merry lile

, at Rome, apparently without great pecuniary embarrassment.

All these indications point to no financial inability or niggard-
liness on the part os his sather. Possibly the villas, and an in-
crease ol income, came to himupon the death of his brother.

rr. Whether Catullus, like Horace, was accompanied to
Rome by his father is doubtful. On the whole, it seems
hardly probable that he was. To say nothing os the con-
siderations possibly connected with the interests of the elder
son, the father was apparently 'resident in Verona at the time
when Julius Caesar was governor ol Gaul (Suet. Iul. 73), and
this lact may indicate that at no time was the family home at
Verona broken up in favor of a new one at Rome.

at Rome the youth was entrusted. And there were many.
