which a part, with lives of Cato andos Atticus, is still extant,
but also of other historical works (cf. c. 1. 6 n.) and of poems
(Plin. Ep. V. 3. 6).

65. Q. Hortensius Ortalus (114-50 nc), Cicero’s greatest
rival as an orator, was also somewhat ofa historian (Vell. ΙΙ.
16. 3), and wrote erotic poems (Ov. Trist. ΙΙ. 4413 Plin. Ep.
V. 3. 5), which the Greeks at the banquet of Antonius Julianus
(Gell. XIX. 9. 7) characterized as invenusta, though they
admitted that Catullus and Calvus wrote some verses compara·
ble with those of Anacreon. Presuming, perhaps, upon his own
gifts as a poet, Hortensius asked Catullus for a poem (c. 65.
18·19),and the poet complied with the request, though with
an absence of compliment that indicates no intimate friendship
with his petitioner, whose much greater age and high position
gave him, however, the power to become an influential patron.
That the friendship made no progress seems to be indicated by
the uncompHmentary allusion to the verses of Hortensius in
c. 95. 3 (cf. however ἕ 25 odfin).

66. The Varus of c. ro is apparently identical with the Varus
of c. 22, who is a friend of Catullus and a criticos poetry, if not
a poet himself. This may well be the distinguished Quintilius
Varus, the Augustan critic (Hor. A . P. 438 ff.) and poet (Acro
and Comm. Cruq. on l.c.). He is called a native of Cre-
mona 3 and his death in 23 rac. (according to Jerome) drew
ι from Horace a touching address of sympathy to Vergil (Carm.
Ι. 24). Judged from the tone of the passage in the Ars
Portica, Quintilius must have been somewhat older than

·· Horace, while yet he could hardly have been born long, if at

all, before Catullus. The attempt to identify the Varus of c. ro
and c. 22 with Alfenus Varus of c. 30 is unsatisfactory.

67. -The Manlius Torquatus, whose marriage with Vinia
Aurunculeia is celebrated inc. 61, was perhaps the L. Manlius
Torquatus whose father was consul in 65 rac, (cf. Hor. Carm.
III. 21. 1; Epod. 13. 6), and who was himself praetor in 49.
He allied himself with the Pompeians, and was killed in Africa
