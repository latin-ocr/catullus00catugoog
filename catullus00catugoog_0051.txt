in which Caesar received news of his death (so Nipperdey inter-
prets the allusion). The connection of Mamurra with the pro-
vincial Ameana (cc. 41, 43) may be assigned to the time when

he was in attendance upon Caesar in his winter joumeys to the
nearer provrnce.

7 5. The poet Volusius of cc. 36 and 95 is probably not to be
identified with Tanusius Geminus, as Muretus and other later
writers would have it. The only ground for such identification
is a remark made by Seneca (Ep. 93. 11 anrrales Tanusii scis
quam ponderosi sint et quid uocantur). But of all the names
that appear in CatulluS, Lesbia and Lesbius are the only ones
known to be pseudonyms (for Mentula is hardly a name, hut an
easily recognized epithet). And the quid uocenmrof Seneca
may readily refer to some other popular characterization of the
work of the annalist, and not to the cacata charta of c. 36. 1.

The metres employed by Catullus are as follows : —

76. Drcrvrrc annus‘rnn (cc. 62, 64) and Eunones (cc.65-
116). The occurrence of spondaic verses is very frequent, and
doubtless is due to Alexandrian intluence. In all, there are
42 such verses of which 34 end in a quadrisyllable. In only
ten instances is this a proper name. In c. 64 there is a suc·
cession of three spondaic verses (vv. 78-80). —The tendency
to employ a succession of spondees in the same verse is strik-
ing. Thus c. 116. 3 is made up entirely of spondeeS, and 71
verses have spondees in the first four places—Thepenthe·
mimeral caesura is by far the favorite‚ though the hephthe-
‘ mimeral occurs occasionally; and the feminine caesura in the
third foot is not unknown, though it is entirely excluded from
the fourth-The hexameters end preferably in a dissyllable
or trisyllable5 but in the ending of the pentameters greater
freedom is allowed. - Hypermeters are found inc. 64. 298
and 4115· 5. Onhiatus,see§86d.
