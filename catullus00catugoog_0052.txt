manooucrrort. xlvii

77. Purra Inwarc annaann (c. 4). Perhaps c. 29 is in the
same mette, but cf. note on Mamurram in v. 3.

78. Innnrc mearan (c. 52, and perhaps c. 29), with the
optional substitution of a spondee for the first iambus of any

dipody. The scheme, then, is, -
tto÷:o-ot-‘o-ot.‘o-ntt.

79. Cnomwmc or Scnzon (cc. 8, 22, 31, 37, 39, 44, 59, 60).
The scheme is as follows : - .

ΙΙόΞέυΙ-ῧΙ-ὐΙ-υΙιζΙέυΙΙ.

Thrice also the thesis is resolved (in cc. 22. 193 37. 53 59. 3,
—unless in c. 37. 5 we read confutuere as a quadrisyllable).

80. Inwmc Tmnnwarun errassem, otherwise called Iam-
bic Septenarius (c. 2 5). The scheme is,- l

ΙΙόΞ-ὐΙ-(ὂ)Ι.ΞυΙ-ὖΙ-ὐΙ-υΙι-Ἰ-ΛΙΙ.

50, 5 3-58l). The scheme is,—

11531-ootzot-ot:otty

It may be remarked that whilethe verse most frequently opens
with the irrational trochee (as always in Martial), there are
nearly seventy exceptions to this rule, and they are about
evenly divided between the regular trochaic opening and that
with tlre iambus, The peculiar experiment with this metre
tried in cc. 5 5 and 58ὸ is noted in the introduction to c. 55.

82. erconrc and Pnnnscnnmc series are combined by
Catullus as follows:-

a. Asecond Glyconic catalectic followed bya second Phere-
cratic acatalectic forms the verse called anennw, used in c. 17·

The scheme is, -
ιι-’.ει-υυι-ὐιι-ιι-’ῠι-υυιίΙ-Λιι.

The first series in this verse ends with a complete word, and
