ioumey to Spain like the laterone with Piso (ef. i 70) may
well have been on the staff of a provincial governor,-prob-
ably about 60 nc, as the reference to Lesbia indicates (cf.

c· ;3.1‘lsli1e)l³iso unfavorably commented upon in cc. 28 and 47

(cf. ξ 68) is probably L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, consul in
58 nc, (the year of Cicero¹s exile), and in 57-5 5 governor ol
Macedonia, where he made an honorable record. After his re-
tum to Rome in 5 5 nc. he attempted to reply to certain stric-
tures of Cicero uttered in his absence, and drew down upon
himself the overwhelming invective power of his adversary in
the famous speech In R'sonem, in which the whole life, char-
acter, aud actions of Piso were held up to undeserved obloquy.

71. The service of Catullus on the staff of C. Memmius,
governor of Bithynia, has already been discussed (§ 29 li).
Concerning Memmius himself we may add further that neither
his political nor his personal character was above reproach.
He was in 54 ne. party to a most barefaced attempt to secure
the consulship by bribing the consuls of that year (Cic. Att.
IV. 18. a), and was charged with the seduction of the wives
of Lucullus (Cic. Art. 1. 18. 3) and Pompey (Suet. Gram.
14). He appears to better advantage as a scholar and the
patron of literary men, especially of Lucretius, who dedicated
his great poem to him. Cicero (Brut. 70. 247) speaks well
of his Greek scholarship, and of his ability in oratory, though
blaming him for lack of application. Accused of ambitus in
5 3 rac, on account of the operations of the preceding year,
he went into exile iu Greece (cf. Cic. Fam. ΧΙΙΙ. 1), where he
died about the year 49.

72. Prominent among the invective poems of Catullus is a
group directed against a certain Gellius. This comprises cc. 74,
80, 88, 89, 90, 91, 116, but the poems are not arranged in
chronological order. Apparently the earliest in composition is
c'. 116, and the second c. 91, —the first indicating that Catullus
had tried to avert the hostility of Gellius by sending him trans·
