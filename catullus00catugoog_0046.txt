less probability may be attributed to him the work on the derie.
ration of the names of the gods ascribed by Macrobius and
Priscian to an author of his nanre: but the verse in criticism
os a grammatical point in Vergil attributed by Cledonius (V.
43. a) to Cornificius Gallus may have been written, as some
have thought, by Cornelius Gallus Only two fragments of the
verses οῖ’ Cornificius have been preserved, one a hendecasylla-
bie (Macr. VI. 4. 12), and the other the latter part of a
hexameter from his Glaucus (Macr. VI. 5. 13). They are
appended by L. Mtiller to his edition oi Catullus. Ἴ

62. The Cato to whom c. 56 is addressed was probably not
that pattern ot' ancient Roman strictnesS, M. Porcius Cato,
later called Uticensis, but the grammarian, Valerius Cato, who
was a countryman of Catullus (Suet. Grom. 11), and whose
amatory poems are mentioned by Ovid (Tul-t. II. 436) in
connection with those of Cinna (cf. ὅ 63), Comilicius (cs.
ἕ 61), and Anser.

63. C. Helvius Cinna, a companion of Catullus on the staff
of Memmius (cf. c. 10. 30 and ἕ 30), whose epic poem, the
Zmyrna, is praised in c. 95, was probably the Caesarian tribune
mistaken for L. Cornelius Cinna, the anti-Caesarian, in the riots
attending the funeral os Julius Caesar, and killed by the popu-
lace (Plut. Brut. 20, Iul. 683 Suet. Iul. 85 3 cf. ShakspereJul.
Cos. III. 3). The insignificant extant fragments of his poems
are appended by L. Mtiller to his edition ol Catullus.

64. The Cornelius of c. 1. 1 seems to be Cornelius Nepos, the
historian3 witness Ausonius, who says (XXIII. 1-3) ‘ Cui. . .
libellum’ Veronensis aitpoeta quondam, irruenteque dedit statim
Nepoti. Nepos (circ. 94-24 ae.) was certainly a provincial

from Cisalpine Gaul (Plin. N. H. III. 127 Nepos Padi aceolo),
and probably a native ol Ticinum (Plin. Ep. IV. 2¹8. 13
Mommsen in Hermes III. p. 62). His acquaintance with
Catullus, though nothing certain can be traced concerning it,
was doubtless sostered by their similarity of origin (cf.§ 12).
Nepos was author not only ol the work De Viris lttustribmmi
