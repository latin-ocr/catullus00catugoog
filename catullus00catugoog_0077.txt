CATULLUS.

Respondi id quod erat, nihil neque ipsis
Nec praetoribus esse nec cohorti,

Cur quisquam caput unctius referret, —
Praesertim quibus esset irrumator
Praetor nec faceret pili cohortem.

‘At certe tamen’ inquiunt, ‘quod illic
Natum dicitur esse comparasti,

Ad lecticam homines' Ego, ut puellae

mentary on the frequent character
of Roman provincial administration.

9. nihil neque ipsis, etc: the
three classes mentioned are the in·
habitants themselves (ipsis), the
governors (praetoribus), and the
'governor's staff (cohorti), and the
order is that of logical emphasis: -
not even the inhabitants have any·
thing; how then can governors, to
say nothing of staff, ever get any·
thing?

11. cur, etc: the indirect ques-
tion depends upon nihil regarded
as a cause- caput unctius refer-
ret: i.e. be rolling in wealth on
his return; a colloquial figure de-
rived from the expensiveness of
fine ointments, which, therefore,
only the rich could use; cf. 6.
8 n.; Plaut. Pseud. 219 numqui
queeipiauest tuorum tua opera hostie
conseruerunt uitidiuseulruu caput?
. Cic. Vere. ll. 2. 22. 54 ita patries-
tritas defhndebat ut ab illis ipse une-
tior abiret,· and an extension of
the same figure in 29. 22 uncta pa-
trimonia. With the comparative
unctius sc. ‘than those of men in
general’; cf. 3. 2 n. uenustiorura,
9. 10 beatiorum.

12. quibus: with oblique refer·
enee to quisquam, as though a
partitive eorum had preceded. -
irrumator, a scurvy sellem the
word, like many others of similar
antecedents, has come to be used

not always in a literal sense, but as
a mere term of abuse, cf. v. 245 28.
9,1o; lntr. 32.

13· faceret pili: cf. 5. 3 u.

¹4· at: ie. in spite of the gen·
eral poverty of the province,-
challenging the sweeping character
of the preceding statement.

15· natum: if Catullus means
that the custom of riding in a litter
originated in Bithynia, he tells us
what we leam from no other source,
-lor the grammarian Probus, in
making a similar statement, prob·
ahly horrowed it from him; but
the custom was common there;
cf. Cic. Vere. II. 5. 11. 27 ut ntes
fuit Bithyniae regibus, lectica
octaphoro fluebatur. Cappadocians
ancl Syrians, men of proverbially
great stature and strength, are often
mentioned as litter-hearers, as are
less frequently Thracians, Liburni·
ans and Moesians (Juw), and in later
days (lauls (Clem. Alex.) and Ger·
mans (Tertull.); cf. Mart. VI. 77. 4
quid te Cappadocum sex enus esse
iuuat? Juv. 6. 351 quae longorum
aeuitur ceruice Syrorum.

16. lecticam: a covered litter,
borne on the shoulders of slaves
(lecticarii), and used in Rome at
first by women and children, but
later by men also, as a vehicle in
the city (where carriages were not
allowed), and for short journeys
into the country.
