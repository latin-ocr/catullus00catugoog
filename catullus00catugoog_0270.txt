-76. ιο] CATULLUS.

Vt iam nec bene uelle queat tibi, si optuma fias,
Nec desistere amare, omnia si facias.

7⁶·

Si qua recordanti benefacta priora uoluptas
Est homini, cum se cogitat esse pium,
Nec sanctam uiolasse fidem, nec loedere in ullo
Diuum ad fallendos numine abusum homines,
5 Multa parata manent in longa aetate, Catulle,
' Ex hoc ingrato gaudia amore tibi.
Nam quaecumque homines bene cuiquam aut dicere

Aut facere, haec ate dictaque laetaque sunt:
Omnia quae ingratae perierunt credita menti.
