CATULLUS.

55·

Oramus, si forte non molestum est,

Demonstres ubi sint tuae tenebrae.

Te campo quaesiuimus minore,

Te in circa, te in omnibus libellis,
5 Te in templo summi louis sacrata.

tell nothing but the plain truth-
unice imperator: comparison with
29. 11 imperator unice and v. 6 ile·
rum suggests forcibly that Julius
Caesar is meant, and that 54 fol-
lowed soon after 29 in composition,
and here refers to it.

55. An appeal to an otherwise
unknown Camerius to disclose his
whereabouts to his friend, who has
been searching through Rome for
him. Similar descriptions of an anx·
ious search for a friend through the
city are not wanting in the come·
dians ; cf. Plaut. Amph. 1009 ff.;
Epist 196 ff.; Ter. Ad. 713 ff.
The poem appears to be an un·
finished experiment in a not very
pleasant modification of the Phalae-
cean verse, and was perhaps, with
the accompanying fragment, 58²³,
found among the papers of Catullus
after his death and published by the
original editor of the Liber. The odd
verses (and also v. 8) through v. 13,
and from that point the even verses,
have a spondee in the second place.
In 58¹³, however, only vv. 1 and 9
have a spondee in the second place.
—Date, 55 rac. (cf. v. 6 n.).

1. si forte, etc: a bit of collo-
quial politeness; cf. Ter. Ad. 806
ausculta paucis, uisi molestumst,
Demea,· Cic. Clueut. 60. 168 lu
autem, uisi molestum est, paulisper
exsurge: Mart. l. 96. 1 si nou rua·
lestum est teque uon piget . . . dicas.

2. tenebrae, lurking-place‚· cf.
Prop. IV. 15. 17 saepe illam immuu-
us passa est habitare tenebris.

3. campo minore: probably so
called to distinguish it from the
great campus Martius ,· and Paulus
(Fest. p. 131) mentions a campus
Martialis on the Caelian‚ where .
horse-taces were held when the
Tiber overflowed the campus Mar-
tius (cf. also Ov. Fast. III. 519-
522). This is possibly the place
meant, as the search passed from
it through the Circus Maximus, by
the shops near the Forum (cf. 37.
2 n.), over the Capitoline, to Pom-
til? spissitudinis&
cf. Prop. III. 2 3. 6 campo quo mouet
illa pedes? Not. et Cur. App. l.
Campi VIII, ete. On the alslative
without iu cf. Ov. and Prop. ll.cc.;
Liv. XXI. 8. 7 iustae acies uelut
patenti campa curialiteraut.

4. circo: ie. the Circus Maxi·
mus, a haunt of idlers; cf. Hor.
Sat. I. 6. 113 ff.—te: not elided,
for no trochee stands in the second
place; while the hiatus with systole
is supported by that in 10. 27; 97.
13 114. 6; cf. Intr. 86 d.-libellis,
book-rhaps, as perhaps in Mart. V.
20. 8 libelli, campus, porticus . . .
laec essent luca semper.

5. templo summi Iouis: the
triple Etruscan temple of Jupiter
Capitolinus with Juno and Minerva,
ascribed to Tarquinius Priscus, was
burned in 83 ac. Sulla began, and

’ Q. Lutatius Catulus in 69 rae. com·

pleted, the new temple, which was
itself burned in 69 nn. under Vitel-
lius (cf. Tac. Hist. III. 72).
