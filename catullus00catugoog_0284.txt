CATULLUS.

96.

Si quicquam mutis gratum acceptumue sepulcris
Accidere a nostro, Calue, dolore potest,
Quo desiderio ueteres renouamus amores
Atque olim missas flemus amicitias,
ς Certe non tanto mors immatura dolori est
Quintiliae, quantum gaudet amore tuo,

9¹7.

Non (ita me di ament) quicquam referre putaui
Vtrumne os an culum olfacerem Aemilio.
Nilo mundius hoc, nihiloque immundius illud,
Verum etiam culus mundior et melior:
5 Nam sine dentibus est. Hoc dentis sesquipedalis,

unpardonable sins in the eyes of an
Alexandrian like Catullus But the
comparison of Volusius to him here
is plainly in respect of his volumi·
nousness.

96. To Calvus on the death of
his wife, Quintilia; cf. Intr. 60.
From Propertius (ΙΙΙ. 34. 89 f.) we
learn that Calvus himself wrote a
threnody on his loss.

1. si quicquam, etc: the
phrase is probably not intended as
an expression of slcepticism which
might destroy the effect of the con·
solation, but to emphasize the apod-
osis following in v. 5 f. ; cf. 76. 17 n.
102. 1. For more definite echoes
of the prevailingagnosticism among
the Romans regarding immortality
cf. Sulpicius ap. Cic. Fam. IV. 5. 6;
Tac. Agr. 46.—mutis sepulcris:
cf. 101. 4 mutam cinerem—gra-
tum acceptumue: the conjunc-
tion of these adjectives is common ;
cf. also 90. 5gratus ut accepto.

2. nostro: of men in general,—

though Catullus had himself felt the
need of similar consolation.

3 f. desiderio, etc: in apposi-
tion with dolore, carrying on the
idea with specification; cf. 2. 8 and
note.

4. missas: not here, as fre-
quently, of a thing voluntarily sur·
rendered, but of one given up in
obedience to a greater power; cf.
66. 29.—amicitias: of the senti·
ment rather than the passion of
love; cf. 109. 6.

97. An exceedingly coarse epi·
gram on a certain Aemilius, of
whom nothing further is known.

r. ita me di ament: acolloquial
form of asseyeration; cf. Ter. Andr.
947 ila me di ament, cred0,· and
similar phrases with iuuare in 61.
196; 66. 18. On the hiatus in
arsis see Intr. 86 d.

3. hoc . . . illud: with this res-
erence of hic to the former and ille
to the latter of two iterns cf. 100. 3.

5. hoc: referring to os, as in v. 3.
