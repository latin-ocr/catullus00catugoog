CATULLUS.

[66 41-

Ille quoque euersus mons est quem maximum in oris
Progenies Thiae clara superuehitur,
45 Cum Medi peperere nouum mare, cumque iuuentus
Per medium classi barbara nauit Athon.
Quid facient crineS, cum ferro talia cedant?
Iuppiter, ut Chalybon omne genus pereat,
Et qui principio sub terra quaerere uenas
50 Institit ac ferri fingere duritiem!
Abiunctae paulo ante comae mea fata sorores
Lugebant, curn se Memnonis Aethiopis
Vnigena impellens nutantibus aera pennis
Obtulit Arsinoes † elocridicos ales equus,

43. maximum: cf. Strab. 331
fr. 33 ὑψηλότατον (of Mt. Athos).
—in oris: not restrictIve of maxi·
mum, but modifying quem directly
(= in litore stantem), ‘that most
mighty promontory-mountain)

44. progenies Thiae: ale. the
sun; Hesiod ( Theog. 371) says that
Thia bore Helius and Selene to
IIyperion; cf. Pind. [stt. 4. 1.

45 f. The cutting by Xerxes of
aship·canal through the isthmus of
Athos is described in HerodVII. 24.

47. quid facient . . . cum . . .
cedant: cf. the inverse construction
of moods in Verg. Ecl. 3. 16 quid
donrini saciant, audent cum talia
ures?
s48. Chalybon, ete: cf. Callim⁴
Frag. 35⁰ Χαλύβων ὡς ἀπόλοιτο
γένος, γειιίθεν ἀντέλλοντα κακὸν
φυτὸν of μιν douram Hor. Sat. ΙΙ.
1. 42 ο poter et rex luppiter, ut
pereat positum robigine telum. The
Chalybes here referred to are un·
doubtedly not those of Spain, but
the tribe of hon-workers in Pontus;
cf. xen. Anah. V. 5.1 ἀφικνοῦνται
εἰς Χάλυβας. οὗτοι ὀλίγοι τε ἦσαν
καί ὁ βίος ἢν τοῖς πλείστοις αὐτῶν
ἀπὸ σιδηρείας.

50. fingere: the verb, usually
applied to easily worked substances
(such as wax and clay), is strongly
contrasted with duritiem the
Chalybes worked against nature irr
learning to dig iron from the con·
cealing earth, and to mould its
hardness so wonderfully into form.

5¹· With this verse begins a pas-
sage of peculiar and probably urr-
surmountable difficulty.— abiunc-
tae (sc. α me), bereaved,· modifying
comae. The loclr had been severed
but a short time from its sister-loclrs
on the head of Berenice, and their
sorrow was still fresh (lugebant),
when it was snatched from the tern-
ple and carried to heaven.

53. unigena: born of the same
parents, the brother (cf. 64. 3οο);
ie. Emathion (cf. Apollod. ΙΙΙ. 12.
4 Τιθωνὸν μὲν οὖν Ἠὼς ἁρπάσασα
δι’ ἔρωτα είς Αἰθιοπίαν κομίζει, κθκεΐ
συνελθοῦσα γεννᾷ παῖδας Ἠμαθίωνα
καί Μέμνονα), who was apparently
identified mythically with the ostrich
(cf. v. 54) as was Memnon himself
with a certain species of black hawk
(cf. Ov. Met. XIII. 600 ff).

54. Arsinoes: Arsinoe was the
sister-wife of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
