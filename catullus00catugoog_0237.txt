[65·3-

Nec potis est dulcis Musarum expromere fetus
Mens animi: tantis fluctuat ipsa malis, —
5 Namque mei nuper Lethaeo gurgite fratris
Pallidulum manans adluit unda pedem,
Troia Rhoeteo quem subter litore tellus
Ereptum nostris obterit ex oculis

10 Nunquam ego te uita

frater amabilior

Adspiciam posthac: at certe semper amabo,
Semper maesta tua carmina morte canam,

Qualia sub densis ramorum concinit umbris
Daulias absumpti fata gemens Ityli, -

3. Musarum fetus: cf. Cic.
T use. V. 24. 68 animifetus.

4. mens animi: cf. Plaut. Epid.

5. Lethaeo gurgite: the river of
forgetfulness is first mentioned by·
Plato Rep. 621 C. Riese cites tre
(earlier) phrase of Simonides 171
Λήθης δόμοι, where the reference,
however, is only to the lower world
in general (cf. Hor. Carne. IV. 7. 27
Lellzoee uincula). Vergil (Aen.
Vl. 705) describes the river as far
within the lower world, Lethaeum·
que domos placidas qui praenotat
ornnem,⁸ but in Culex 215 Lethaeas
transnare per undas is clearly
meant, as here, the boundary·stream
of Orcus, from beyond which there
is no return (elsewhere the Styx);
cf. Prop. V. 7. 91; Tib. ΙΙΙ. 3. ro
nudus Lethaea cogerer ire rale,·
ΙΙΙ. 5. 24 cognoscere Lethaeum
ratem.

β. pallidulum: the diminutive

of affection ; the paleness is that oi
death—adluit unda pedem: as
a general expression for crossinga
river, although it strictly refers only
to fording, while Lethe was crossed
by boat; cf. Prop. I. 20. 8 siue
Aniena tuos tinxerit unda pedes.

7. subter: the idea is closely
connected with that of v. 8 obterit,
crnshes, the utterance of the brother·
ly love that shudders at the grave ;
contrast the familiar sit ribi terra
leuis.

10 ff. te, etc: the fresh grief of
the writer carries him away from
his theme into an apostrophe to
his dead brother.-uitaamabilior:
cf. 64. 215 n.

14. Daulias: so the transformed
Philomela (Ov. Mer. VI. 424 ff.)
was called, according to Thuc. II.
29, from Daulis, the town of Phocis,
where Tereus lived; Homer, how·
ever (Od. XIX. 518 ft), represents
Itylus as the only son of Zethus,
king of Thebes, by Aedon, daughter
of Pandareus‚ king of Crete, and
slain unwittingly by his own mother,
who was jealous of the motherhood
of Niobe, and supposed herself to
be killing Niobe’s eldest son.
