aud the hope of budding fortune (cf.§ 41), to win him back'

27. As partos the history of Catullus alter the break with
Lesbia has thus been anticipated in order to indicate the course
of his struggle with himself, it may he well to pause here a lew
moments longer to ask who this Lesbia was. That we have in
the poems of Catullus a real and notan imaginative sketch of
a love-episode cannot be once doubted by him who reads
Lesbia is not a lay figure, a mere peg 011 which to hang fancieS,
like the shadowy heroines of Horace. T hat she was no liber-
tina, but awoman os education and of social position, is equally
clear from the passages already cited. The name Lesbia, there·
fore, is immediately suggestive os a pseudonym; and not only
the fashions of poetry, but the position of the lady herself,
appear at once to justify this expedient on the part of her poet-
lover. To this antecedent probability is added the direct tes-

timony of Ovid, who says (T rist. II. 427), sie sua lasciue can-
tata est saepe Camllo semina cui falsum Lesbia nemen erat.
Apuleius carries us a step further, saying (Apol. 10),eadem
igilur opera accusent C. Catullum quod Lesbiam pro Clodia
nominarit. The name Lesbia is the proper metrical equivalent
for Clodia, as the pseudonym of a mistress should be on the
lips of a Roman lover (cf. Bentley on Hor. Corm. ll. 12. 13;
Acro on Hor. Sat. I. 2. 64).

the sixteenth century to identify this Clodia with the sister of
Ρ. Clodius Pulcher, Cicero’s foe, wife of Q. Caecilius Metellus
Celer, who was praetor nc, 63, then governor of Cisalpine
Gaul, consul for the year 60 nc, and died in 59, not without
suspicion that his wife poisoned him (cs. Cic. Cael. ²4· 60 ;
Quint. VIII. 6. 53). Among almost all Catullian scholars of
the present century this view has found acceptance‚ in spite
of the express dissent of a few. The general character and
course of life of this Clodia ‘Quadrantaria’ (cf. Cic. Cael. and
