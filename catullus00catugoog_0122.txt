CATULLUS.

5 Desissemque truces uibrare iamboS,
Electissima pessimi poetae
Scripta tardipedi deo daturam
Infelicibus ustilanda lignis
Et hoc pessima se puella uidit

10 locose lepide uouere diuis
Nunc, o caeruleo creata ponto,
Quae sanctum Idalium Vriosque apertos

saneta cnm coniuge ,· 64. 268 sane·
tis diuis. - Veneri Cupidinique:
cl.3,1n.

5. truces iambos: the tradi-
tional weapons of satire since the
time of Archilochus ; cf. 12. 10 n. ;
Hor. Carne. I. 16. 22 me quoqne
pectorisferuor in celeres ionzbos erei-
sit furentem ‚· A. P. 79 Archilochum
proprio rabies ‹zrnrauit ianebo .· the
poerns here ineant are 8 and, per·
haps, 37, possibly with others not
included in the final liber Catulli.

6. electissima, choieestfromtheir
badness, the worst; with the irony
of meaning cf. 33. 1 optime,· 37. 14
hessi beatique—pessimi poetae:
so Lesbia had in a pet called Catul-
lus, in that he made her uncomfort·
able by his truces inuehi ,· and she
would, of course, dedicate toVulcan
, not the bad poetry of some undeter-
mined poetaster, but the particular
verses that had stung her, which
would naturally be destroyed after
areconciliation as painful memorials
(cf. Hor. Carm. l. 16 on a similar
occasion). Catullus now playfully
ignores the real meaning of her

’ words, and pitches upon Volusius

as the pessimus poeto of his acquaint-
ance, whose works are therefore due
to Vulcan.

7. tardipedi deo: ie. Vulcan,
who was lamed by the fall from

heaven to Lemnos (Hom. Il. I.
586 ff.); cf. Tib. I. 9. 49 illa uelim

rapida Volcanus carmina stantma
torreat: Quint. VIII. 6. 24 Vulca-
num pro agne sezelgo audimus.

8. infelicibus lignis: cf. Ma-
crob. III. 20. 3 arbores quae inse·
rum deorum auertentiumque in
tutelerunt, eos infelices nominant
.. ,qzee'hus portento prodzgr'aque
molo eonrburi iubere opertet: Legg.
Regg. ap. Liv. l. 26 infelici arbori
reste suspendite [perduellionem]

9. hoc: sc. uoluere—pessima
puella: spoken jestingly (cf. 55.
10), but in reminiscence of the
same term applied by her to him
(v. 6), which he now attempts to
pass on to the unfortunate Volusius.

10. iocose lepide: Catullus as·
serts (of course without foundation)
that the vow was made sportively
in the sense in which he has just
interpreted it.

11. nunc: the moment of con-
summation of the vow has corne,
and the poet as officiating priest
stands ready with the offering, and
begins the final prayer. —caeruleo
creata ponto: by early tradition
Aphrodite was born of the sea-fuam ι
cf. lles. Tlseog. 1953 Anacr. 54, etc.
Note the solemn effect of the mani·
fuld address, with which cf. the
prayer of Chryses to Phoebus Hom.
Il. Ι. 37 a, etc.

12. Idalium: atownandwooded
mountaln of Cyprus, whereon stood
a renowned temple of Aphrodite,
