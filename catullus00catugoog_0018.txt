v4. With regard to his full‘name we are left in some doubt.
He refers to himself by name in his poems twenty-five times,
but in each case only by the cognomen, Catullus, while the
better manuscripts of his writings are inscribed simply Catulli
Veronensis Liber. Yet there is no difficulty in ascertaining his
gentile name from other writers. Varro (L. L. Vll. 50), Sue-
tonius (Iul. 73), Porphyrio (on Hor. Sat. 1. 10. 19), Charisius
(1. 97), Jerome (Cluana. Abr. 1930), all give it as Valerius.
There are sewer references to his praenomen. Four of the later
and interpolated manuscripts give it in their titles as Quintus,
and until lately 'it was supposed that to this indication might be
added the testimony of the elder Pliny (N. H. XXXVII. 81).
Relying upon such authority Scaliger went so far as to emend
a. 67. 12 so as to bring ln sor the unintelligible words qui te
the praenomen of the poet in the vocative, Quinte‚· and his
suggestion won the approval of even so keen a critic as· Luch⁴
mann. But it is now universally conceded that the initial Q.
prefixed to the word Catullus in the passage specified from.
Pliny is an interpolation, the best MS.‚ the codex Bamber·
gensis, containing only the cognomen without prefix. There is,
moreover, positive evidence in favor of a different praenomen.
Jerome (la), ln speaking 01 the birth 01 the poet, calls him in
full C. Valerius Catullus, and'Apuleius (Apul. ro), whose ac-
curacy, however, in the matter of names is not above suspicion,
calls him C. Catullus. In the face, then, of the testimony
of interpolated manuscripts only, his praenomen must stand
established as Gaius.
> 5. Conceming the bfrthplace of Gaius Valerius Catullus
there is abundant testimony. The titles 01 the best MSS. of
his works call him Veronensis, and Jerome (lc.) declares him
¹ born at Verona. In this testimony concur his admirers among
the poets of the centuries immediately following (eg. Ov. Am.
III. 15. 7; Marti. 61. 13 X. 103. 53 XIV. 1953 Auson. Op.
²3· 1) 3 and his own writings furnish confirmatory evidence 01
tlte same fact. . He calls himself (c. 3013) Transpadanus {bt
