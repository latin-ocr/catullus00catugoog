6. The year of his birth and that os his death are stated by
Jerome in his edition of the Chronicles os EusebiuS, probably
on the authority os the De Poetis oi Suetonius. Under date of
, the year of Abraham 1930 (= iac. 87) Jerome says, Gaius
Valerius Calullus scraptar lyrr'cm Veronae nascitur, and under
that ol 1960, or, according to some Mss, 1959 (= ac. 57, or1
58), he says Catullus XXX. aetatis anno Romae moritur.
There is nothing to contradict Jerome’s date lor the birth ol
the poet, but unfortunately sor our belief in his entire accuracy‚
a number os the poems of Catullus were clearly written later
than iac. 57,-some oi them at least as late as the end ol the
year 55 B.c.‚ or the beginning of the year 54 (ag. cc. 11, 29, 5 3,
113). Jerome is, therefore, certainly wrong about the date of
the poet’s death, and hence about at least one ol the two other
statements, the date of his birth and his age at death. The
only serap ol evidence lrom other sources on these points is the
vague statement os Ovid that Catullus died young (Am. ΙΙΙ. 9,
62 obuius huic [in Elysio] hedera iuuenalia cinctus tempora
cum Caluo, doctr Catulk, tuo).

7. The poems of Catullus himself fumish us, however, with
some good negative evidence conceming the date of his death.
lt probably occurred in the year 54 ac. In the first place,
there are no poems that clearly must have been written later
than the close os the year 55 rao, or the earlier months oi the
year 54, nor any that are even capable os more ready explana·
tion, isa later date for their composition be supposed. The re-
’ mark about the consulship ol Vatinius (c. 52), which did not
take place till the end ol the year 47 ac, forms no exception
to this statement (cs. Commentary), and the prosecution of
