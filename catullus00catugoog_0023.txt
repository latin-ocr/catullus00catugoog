ι 5. In life at Rome, then, Catullus found his full develop-
ment as a poet. Already from the donning ol the toga uirilt's,
so he tells us (c. 68. 15 fi), he bad been busied with love and
love-verses. But whether this period antedated or followed his
coming to Rome cannot be decided, since the date ol publica-
tion 0l the Chronica of Nepos (c. 1. 8) is unknown, and on this
alone could a decision os the other point be based. Such
poems as those that concern Aufilena (cc. roo, 110, 111) may
possibly date hom the Veronese period of the poet's lise
(though c. 82 cannot possibly do so), and yet it is just as
possible that their scene was Rome (cl. introductory note to
c. 100), and the same may be said ol the poems concerning
Ameana (cc. 41, 43). Much more likely isit, however, that
of the other poems that show some connection with Veronese
affairs cc. 17 and 67 date from his residence in his native city,
while c. 35 was surely written during only a temporary visit
there (cs. Commentary).

humor brought them forth. But at Rome, and not long after
he arrived at Rome, Catullus met the mastering passion of his
tile, and beside the verses to which it gave birth the melodious
chamber ditties os Horace and the elaborated passions of the
elegiasts are but as tinkling cymbals. To the woman who exer·
eised this wonderful power over him he gives the name os Lesbia.
But more osten he is not content with a name, and the familiar
terms ol endearment flow' from his lips with a newer and deeper
meaning ; for he delights to feel that though his experience
ison the outside like that of other men, his mistress is peerless
in virtues and his love sor her a love passing that os women.
On bis side the passion was sudden and intense. He adopts

the words ol Sappho, and tells Lesbia (c. 51) os the deadly
