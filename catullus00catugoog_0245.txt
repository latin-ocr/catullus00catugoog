CATULLUS.

[aare

Lumina, Callisto iuncta Lycaoniae,

Vertor in occasum, tardum dux ante Booten,
Qui uix sero alto mergitur Oceano,

Sed quamquam me nocte premunt uestigia diuum,

70 Lux autem canae Tethyi restituit,

(Pace tua fari hic liceat, Rhamnusia uirgo:
Namque ego non ullo uera timore tegam,

Nec si me infestis discerpent sidera dictis,
Condita quin ueri pectori} euoluam)

dwelt among men, and was the last
of the immortals to leave earth when
the brazen age carne on; cf. Hyg.
Astrom. ΙΙ, 25; Ον. Met. Ι. 149
uirgo caede madentes, ultima cae·
lestnm, terras Astraea reliquit.
According to another tradition
Virgo was Erigone, who hanged
herself through grief at the murder
of her father, Icarius, hy shepherds
to whom he had for the first time
in their lives given wine to drinlr,
and who supposed themselves pois·
oned by him; cf. Apollod. Ill. 14.
73 Hyg. Feb. 1303 Astron. ll. 4.
—narnque: postpositive‚ asin 64.
384; but nowhere else before Vergil
does it stand after so many words in
its clause3 cf. Draeger Hist. Synt.
ΙΙ,Ι ρ, 162.—Leonis: according to
Hyg. Astron. ll. 24 the Nemean
lion slain by Heracles.

66. Callisto: dative; she was
the daughter of the Arcadian Ly·
caon, and an attendant of the hunt·
ress Artemis; but being ravished
hy Zeus and banished from the
presence of her mistress, she was
changed by Hera into a bear, and
later, on being slain by her own
son Arcas, was placed among the
stars as the constellation Ursa Ma·
jor or Helice; cf. Ov. Met. Il.
401 ff.; Fast.11.153ff.

67. Booten: said by some to be
Icarius (cf. v. 65 n.); by others,

to be Arcas (v. 66 n.) or Lycaon3
cf. Ov. Fast. VI. 235 f.

68. uix sero, εἴας this was a
traditional characteristic of Bootes
from the time of Homer (cf. Od. V.
272 ὀψὲ δύοντα Βοώτην) and is ex-
plained hy Sir Geo. C. Lewis (Astron.
oftlre Ana, p. 59 ap. Ellis) as de·
rived from the fact that Bootes rises
in a horizontal‚ but sets in a verti·
cal, attitude.

69 f. sed quamquam, εἴας tle.
although Ι am one of the stars, and
keep company with the gods; cf.
Atat. 339 θεῶν ὑπὸ ποσσὶ φορεῖταις
Verg. Ecl. 5. 57 sub pedibus uidet
nubes nsidera Daphnis.

70. lux, εἴας rie. at the approach
of dawn Ι set beneath the western
wave.—Tethyi (= mari): cf. 88.
5, and with the Greek dative, 64.
247.

71· Rhamnusia uirgo: Neine
sis (cf. 64. 395 n.; 68. 77) might
punish the arrogance that exalted
in estimation things human above
things divine.

73. nec: apparently the first in·
stance of the use of nec in the
sense of ne quidem. — discerpent:
perhaps the only instance of the
figurative use of this word in the
sense of nevile: cf. however carpo
and concerpe.

74. quin: depending on non
tegam, v. 73 being parenthetical.
