these prossers now made to him through, aud by, Furius and
Aurelius were definitely and disdainsully rejected (c. 11),-
with a manly, not a petulant disdain, lor Catullus could not
even then forget that he had loved Lesbia.

42· This manly utterance was almost the last ol the poet's
lif . A lew scattered verses there may have been, closing per-
haps with the touching appeal written from Verona (cl. § 56)

it. For he was not outside of it, but a part ol it to the lullest
degree, swayed by its ever-changiug emotions. Such a nature
must of necessity ever remain in many essential aspects the
nature of a child. And such was the nature ol Catullus
throughout his brief life,-warm in quick affections, hot in
swist hatreds, pulsing with most active red blood.

and the excellence os his taste, his verses show no ruggedness
