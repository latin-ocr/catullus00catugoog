ol lile in the capital during this most active period in the his·
tory ol Rome, there arose a school of writers who, though often
conservatives in politics‚ were radicals in poetry. The tenden-
cies os the traditional Roman past were by them utterly disre-
garded.= Inspiration was drawn from the stirring lise into which
they were plunged, as well as from the sympathetic study of
the sources os poetic art among both the earlier Greeks and
the Alexandriana As was to be expected, their models of
rhythm were not the rude hexameters and ruder Saturnians of
their Roman predecessors, but the more polished versification
ol the Greeks ; and their subjects were sometimes their own
personal experiences and emotions, and sometimes themes sug-
gested by their Greek prototypes. So a new school os Roman
poetry arose and flourished, to be superseded in turn by the
polished Augustans, who cultivated the niceties of elegance, but
at the expense ol verva.

3. Ol this new school ol poets the most prominent and
interesting figure is Catullus. It is possible to know him per-
sonally as only now and then an ancient writer can be known
to us, and yet he gives us but few definite biographical facts
concerning himself, while still sewer are given by other authors
os his own and later ages, But the little body of poems that
constitute his extant works is so replete with his intense person·
ality, and shows lorth so unreservedly his every emotion, that
the man stands out before us as does no other man ol the age
with the exception of two or three ol its political leaders. And
all this is true, even though we acknowledge‚ as we are bound
to do, thatin many questions of importance concerning his lise
we must be content with aworking hypothesis instead os a
series of established facts, and that the biographer, as the
interpreter of the poems of CatulluS, must be understood to be
presenting probabilities, and not certainties.
