CATULLUS.

Comi moenia Lariumque litus:
Nam quasdam uolo cogitationes
Amici accipiat sui meique.
Quare, si sapiet, uiam uorabit,
Quamuis candida milies puella
Euntem reuocet manusque collo
10 Ambas iniciens roget morari,
Quae nune, si mihi uera nuntiantur,
Illum deperit impotente amore:
Nam quo tempore legit incohatam
Dindymi dominam, ex eo misellae

4. Comi: in the year 59 B.c.‚ in
accordance with the Vatinian law,
Julius Caesar settled 5000 colonists
at Comum, a town already estab-
lished under Cn. Pompeius Strabo,
and called the place Nouum Co-
mum. Com0‚ the modern town,
lies at the southern end 01 the west·
ern arm of Lacus Larius (Lago di
Como), about thirty miles north of
Mediolanum (Milan).

5. cogitationes: Catullus desires
to entice his friend to visit him, and
so speaks with playful vagueness of
certain weighty matters that 000 1)0
communicared only by word of
mouth. The whole tone of the
poem is opposed to any serious in-
terpretation of the phrase.

6. amici sui meique: the same
playful mysteriousness of expression
is kept up here, but Caecilius un-
doubtedly interpreted it correctly to
mean that the friend was the writer
himself. So Catullus speaks of him-
self to Alfenus in 30. 2 as tui ami-
culi.

7. uiam uorabit: an unusual,
but perfectly intelligible phrase, per-
haps favored by the alliteration, and
augmenting hy its exaggerated char·
aeter the playfulness 01 the urgency.

8. candida: 01. 13. 4 n.

ro. roget morari: for the more
usual construction 01 rogare with ul
see13.14.

12. illum deperit, is dying sor
aian 01. 100. 2; Plaut. Cas. 449
lu'c ipsus Casinam deperit; Nem.
Bucol. 2. 70 rusticus Alcon te per-
eam,· and in 45. 5 perire used
absolutely.— impotente, violent ,·
cf.4.18n.

13. quo tempore: denoting the
startingpoint 01 0 continued action,
as indicated by v. 14 ex eo,· cf. 68.
15 tempore quo with 68. 20, where
the continuance of activity from the
initial period is clearly indicated.-
legit: sc. illa,· she read the open-
ing verses lent her by the author;
cf. 42, where Catullus was unable
to recover his tablets lent, perhaps,
unrler similar circumstances. The
custom 01 public recitation by the
author himself was introduced later
by Asinius Pollio (01. 12. 6).

14. Dindymi dominam: i.e. a
poem, or play, based on the story 01
Cyhele; 01. 63. 13, 91, and introduc·
tory note to that poem—misel-
lae: she is pitied only as suffering
love's pleasing pain ; cf. 45. 215
