CATULLUS.

43·

Salue, nec minimo puella naso
Nec bello pede nec nigris ocellis
Nec longis digitis nec ore sicco
Nec sane nimis elegante lingua,
5 Decoctoris amica Formiani.

Ten prouincia narrat esse bellam?
Tecum Lesbia nostra comparatur?
Ο saeclum insapiens et infacetum!

43. Another uncomplimentary
address to the Ameana of 41 (cf.
vv. 1 and 5 of 43 with 3 and 4 of
41). lt seems to have been com-
posed while Catullus was still on
good terms with Lesbia (hence in
60-58 B.c.), for it is well-nigh irn-
possible that he should defend her,
even as a paragon of beauty only, ·
after the settled bitterness of their
final separation. —Metre, Phalae-
cean.

2. nigris ocellis: cf. Hor. Carm.

p 3. longis digitis: cl. Prop. II.
2. 5 fulua conta est longaeque ma·
nus, et maxima toto corpore, et
incedit uel Ioue digna soror. Even
the absurdly long fingers pictured
in the older vase-paintings may indi-
cate the partiality of the ancients
for this mark of beanty.

4. nec nimis elegante, none too

'vfined; cf. the similar use of nimis

and nimium in 56. 43 60.5; 64.
²23 93. 1; and on the litotes also
Mart. IX. 81.3 non nimium curo.
—linguaz after mentioning de·
tails that appeal to the eye, Catullus
passes to that which offends the ear,
-for elegans is apparently not used
of the shape of features. The slob-
bering lips (v. 3) were naturally ac·
companied by a thick and awkward
tongue that disfigured the speech.

7. comparatur: it may be that
the city-man Mamurra himself had
inflamed the vanity of the provin·
cial Ameana by comparing her with
the popular beanty of the capital.
It is not likely that the relations
between Catullus and Lesbia were
discussed in the Province.

tom of interchange of literary pro·
ductions among friends (cf. 14),
had sent Catullus a copy of his
