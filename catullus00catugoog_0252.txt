CATULLUS. 179

Naufragum ut eiectum spumantibus aequoris undis
Subleuem et a mortis limine restituam,
5 Quem neque sancta Venus molli requiescere somno
Desertum in lecto caelibe perpetitur,
Nec ueterum dulci scriptorum carmine musae
Oblectant, cum mens anxia peruigilat,
Id gratum est mihi, me quoniam tibi dicis amicum
ιο Muneraque et Musarum hinc petis et Veneris.
Sed ⁴tibi ne mea sint ignota incommoda, Manli,
Neu me odisse putes hospitis officium,

The great grief expressed in vv.

temporary estrangement or separa-

to her death; cf. also v. 13 n.

11 fs. Manlius, who apparentlyhas
not heard of the affliction of Catul-
lus, had in the first part of his letter
begged for consolatory verses from
him, and in the second, urged his
return to Rome, supporting his
urgency by hints about the loose
life of Lesbia during the unexplained
absence of her lover. Catullus here
and in vv. 33 ff. replies to the first
part of the letter, and to the second
