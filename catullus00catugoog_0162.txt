CATULLUS.

Nec nuces pueris neget
Desertum domini audiens
Concubinus amorem.

Da nuces pueris, iners
Concubine: satis diu
Lusisti nucibus: libet
Iam seruire Talasio
Concubine, nuces da.

Sordebant tibi uilicae‚
Concubine, hodie atque heri:

own home the arrival os the bride,
and therefore not present to hear
the verses addressed to him; while
in place os the bridegroom (v.

Paul. Fest. 85 fescennini uersus,
qui cancbantur in nuptiis, ex urbe
Fescennina dicuntur allati, siue
idea dicti quia fascinum puta·
bantur arcere (cf. 5. 12 n.); Hor.
Ep. ΙΙ. 1. 145 Fescennina licentia
uersibus alternis opprobria rustica
fudit: Sen. Rh. p. 223 B. inter
nuptiales Fescenninas in crucem
eneri nostri iocabantur. Similar
iicentious catches directed against
the general were sung by his sol-
diers in the triumphal procession
(cf. Suet. lul. 49 and 51).

128. nuces pueris: as a part os
the marriage ceremonies the bride·
groom scattered nuts among the
crowd os bystanders; cs. Verg. Ecl.
8. 29 tibi ducitur uxor: sparge,
marite, nuces, and the comments
thereupon by Servius, who gives
several explanations os the custom.

129. desertum, ete: iu. per-
ceiving that his love sor his master

- isnow slighted.

catus to whom the (traditionally
libellous) fescennines represent the
bridegroom as having been de·
voted.

131. iners: the favorite has thus
sar enjoyed a life os idleness; cs.
Cic. N. D. Ι. 36. 102 Epicurus quasi
pueri delicati nznil cessatione melius
existimat.

132.satis diu: ie. you have
long enough by favor os your nias·
ter enjoyed a child’s free lise ( f.
Servius l.c.); now scatter nuts to
show that the life os irresponsibility
is over for you.

134. seruire: contrasted with
lusisti ,· you have thus sar played;
now your master chooses the ser·
viee of Talasius, and sport is over.—
Talasio: for the traditional origin
of this distinctively Roman marriage-
cry that corresponded to the Greek
cry os Hymen, see Liv. 1. 9. 12.

136. sordebant, eto: iu. at your
master’s country-seat even the wives
os the bailiffs, so much above com·
mon slaves like yourselss were but
