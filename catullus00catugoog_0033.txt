it at Amastris rather than at the seaport of Nicaea. And all this,
indeed, may be true, in spite os the fact that c. 46 apparently
speaks os Nicaea as the point of his immediate departure home·
ward; for various reasons might be suggested to account sor a
journey to the eastern partos the province alter bidding Nicaea
a final farewell.

36. In c. 46. 6 the poet speaks ol a plan os visiting claras
Areae urbes on his return voyage. He seems also to feel some
joy at the prospect, but this is the only passage in his writings
that shows any susceptibility to the charm os historic associa-
tions connected with the ancient Greek cities. The course ol
the homeward voyage is but vaguely sketched in e. 4, and the
only city actually mentioned there as visited on the joumey is
Rhodes (c. 4. 8), though we may infer from c. 46 that other
famous sites between the Hellespont and Rhodes were not
neglected by him. He may even have visited Athens, for his
little ship probably was drawn across the Corinthian isthmus by
the famous shiprailway instead of braving the dangers os the
longer and rougher passage around the Malean cape. Yet no
such mention os Athens exists in his writings as would suggest
that he had ever visited, or cared to visit, that city. A similar
doubt besets the question os his point of debarkation in Italy.
It the expressions ol c. 4 were to be taken literally, we must
understand that the phasellus carried its master actually up the
Po and the little Mincius into the Garda-lake, even to the
shores ol Sirmio itself. But this is well-nigh impossible, and
even if possible, is it likely that the poet, so eager to reach
home, would have submitted to the tedium os a tow-boat's
voyage (for surely the phasellus could not sall up the Mincius),
when a few hours by post from the mouth of the Po would have
brought him to his desired haven? Apparently both the begin-
ning and the end of the voyage of the phasellus as recounted
in c. 4 are not to be interpreted with strict literalness. But the
rapturous joy with which Sirmio is saluted in c. 31 lorbids us
to suppose that the poet tirst visited Rome, and later made his
