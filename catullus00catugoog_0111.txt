CATULLUS.

Eone nomine, imperator unice,

Fuisti in ultima occidentis insula,

Vt ista uestra diffututa mentula
Ducenties comesset aut trecenties?
Quid est alid sinistra liberalitas?

Parum expatrauit an parum elluatus est?
Paterna prima lancinata sunt bona;

wine-bibbing, and is not used in as sharing blame with Caesar in the
the sense of 33. 4 and 57. 8, nor in matter ; cf. also vv. 21=24

that of 80. oand 88. 83 yet Sueto· 14. ducenties aut trecenties:
nius (lul. 53) reports that Caesar sc. centena milia sestertium, as
was abstemious in regard to food regularly with numeral adverbs in
and ‹trinu-aleo: gambling had the expression of sums of money.
grown to be such a passion among Ducenti as well as trecenti (on
the young Romans that it was which cf. 9.2n.) is used of indefi-
deemed a serious vice and re· nitely large number; cf. 37. 73
strained by law; cf. Cic. Plril. XIII. Hor. Sat. 1. 10. 60 areret scripsisse

Cat. II. 10. 23 in liis gregibus onr-
nes aleatores, omncs adulteri, erueres
impuri impudicique uersentur.

11. eo nomine, ou tleis account,
one of the most frequent of the
phrases borrowed from book-keep·
ing. The demonstrative refers on-
ward to the ut-clause in v. 13.
—imperator unice: in ironical
praise; repeated in 54. 7.

12. ultima, etc: cf. v. 4 n.—
Wildest rumors had long been afluat
about the vast wealth to be found iu
the interior of Britain, and many
young Roman spendthrifts had de-
sired to join Caesar's expedition
thither. He actually secured noth-
ing of value‚ but evidently the true
news had not yet spread through
Italy.

others. Cf. 34. 8 n. — sinistra libe-
ralitas: since the giving was made
possible by robbery (cf. 12. 1 n.);

Sall. Cat. 52. 11 ff. quia bana aliena

The question in this verse touches
upon the fitness of giving such gifts;
that in the next verse upon Mamur·
ra’s fitness to receive them.

18. praeda Pontica: probably
not that brought back by Pompey
in 62 Bc. from the conquest of
Mithradates, but that from the cap·
ture of Mitylene in 79 B.c., when
Caesar was an officer in the army of

debauchee, as 17. 21 iste meus stu-

nia. Thus early was the patrimony

por, of a dull fellow. Mamurra is of Mamurra already squandered‚

of course the man referred to (cf.

94. 105, 114, 115, and Intr. 73).
Τὴε possessive points to Pompey

and thus early, when gains were
but small, did Caesar begin to lavish

wealth upon him.
