CATULLUS.

[⁶450-

50 Haec uestis priscis hominum uariata figuris
Heroum mira uirtutes indicat arte.
Namque fluentisono prospectans litore Diae
Thesea cedentem celeri cum classe tuetur
Indomitos in corde gerens Ariadna furores

55 Necdum etiam sese quae uisit uisere credit,
Vt pote fallaci quae tunc primum excita somno
Desertam in sola miseram se cernat harena.
Immemor at iuuenis fugiens pellit uada remis,
Irrita uentosae linquens promissa procellae.

60 Quem procul ex alga maestis Minois ocellis

50. With this verse begins the
episode of Arladne’s Lament‚ which
extends through v. 266, thus form-
ing more than half of the entire
poem, and setting in striking eon·
trast the unhappy love of Ariadne
with the happy love of Thetis.
EpIsodic digressions of a similar
character, depicting actions repre-
sented ln graving or embroidery,
are as old as the description of the
shield of Achilles (Hom. Il. XVIII.
478 ft), and are multiplied in later
writers. With the episode of Catul-
lus may be compared the story of
Arladne as told by Ovid in Art.
Am. Ι. 527-564; He'r. 10.

52. fluentisono: ἅπαξ λεγόμε-
νον, though fluctisonus and undiso-
nus are found in post-Augustan
poets. The word has reference to
the crash of breakers upon a

Crete, whence the tradition may
have been transferred to Naxos, the
favorite haunt of DIonysus, as the
later story of Ariadne's rescue by
Dionysus gained ground. Catullus
certainly must have followed the
later tradition, if he had any definite
tradition in mind.

53. A favorite subject in the
Pompeian freseoes is Ariadne awak-
ing from sleep and gazIng after the
departing ship ofTheseus; cf. Roux
Herc. et Pompeii, passim—classe:
cf. v. 212n.

54. indomitos furores: of un-
controllable love; cf. 5ο. 113 64.
943 68.129.

55. Cf. Ov. Her. 10. 31 aut uidi,
aut tanquam quae me uidisse puta-
rem.

56. fallaci: sleep is traitorous
since he made the secret flight of

recle-bound coast, perhaps here to Theseus possible; cf. Ov. Her. 10.

point the impossibility of escape; 5 in quo me somnusque meus reale
ef. v. 121 spumosa ad litora Diae, prodidit et tu.

and the more neutral epithet used 57. desertam, miseram: with
by Homer in Od. XI. 325 Δίῃ ἐν this use of the adjectIve miser, in·
diremtum-mae: asserted by sev· stead of the adverb, with another
eral of the Greeks to b'e but an ear· adjective, cf. 65. 21 miserae oblitae. ·
lier name for Naxos. But Homer 58. immemor: used absolutely
(Od. XI. 321 ff.) very probably and with similar meaning in 30. 1.
thought of the island of Dia that 59. Cf.30. 10 n.

lies very near the north coast of 60. ex alga: ie. from the beach;
