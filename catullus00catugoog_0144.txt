CATULLUS.

Per consulatum perierat Vatinius:
Quid est, Catulle? quid moraris emori?

53.

Risi nescio quem modo e corona,
Qui, curn mirifice Vatiniana
Meus crimina Caluus explicasset,

‘strumae Nani’ eius quem Catullus
poeta iu sella curuli uisum indigne
tulit, where the reproduction oi the
order of the words in Catullus seems
to indicate that Pliny understood
struma to be an epithet and not a
true cognomen.

3. perierat: παρὰ προσδοκίαν,
sor iurat. - Vatinius: in the year
55 the Caesarians succeeded in
electing Vatinius praetor over Cato.
Already in 56 Cicero had charged
him with impudent assurance te-
garding a future consulship, and to
the same characteristic Catullus
refers here. But the coveted ad-
vancement was doubtless promised
by Caesar at Luca, and this promo-
tion to the praetorship was regarded
but as a step thereto by Vatinius
and by Catullus as well, whose in·
dignation was all the more fired
by it.

4. The first verse is identical with
the last also in 16 and 36.

53. An anecdotal jesting corn·
pliment to the oratorical power oi
Calvus, as 50 was a compliment to
his poetical talent. Tacitus (Dial.
21) speaks of the orations of Calvus
against Vatinius as still read, prae-
cipua secunda ex iis aratio, as it
there were at least three oi them.
He also says (Dial. 34) that Calvus
was not much more than 22 years
old when he attached Vatinius iis
orationibus quas hodie quaque cum

admiratione legimus. This remark
may well apply to the prosecution
mentioned by Cicero (Vat. 14) as
occurring in 58 13.c., when Calvus
was 24 years old. No records exist
of any further prosecution of Vati·
nius by Calvus until that oi August,
54 nc, when Cicero appeared sor
the deience. But when Cicero in
56 tac. crass-examined Vatinius (see
In Vatinium) while conducting the
detence oi Sestius, Calvus promised
to indict Vatinius, apparently at
once (Cic. Quint. Fr. ΙΙ. 4. 1), and
the trial may well have come oli
speedily, though doubtless an acquit-
tal was secured by the same inllu-
encesthatimmediatelygaveVatinius
the praetorship for 55 B.c., and hui-
ried him into office (Cic. Quint. Fr.
ll. 7. 3) to escape further prosecu-
tion. At this unrecorded trial in
56 tte. the famous second speech oi
Calvus was probably delivered, and
to it Catullus doubtless refers here.
—Metre, Phalaecean.

1. corona: a circle of auditors,
especially at a trial; cf. Cic. Flac.
28. 69 a iudicibus aratia auertitur,
uox in coronam turbamque effundi
tur,· Hor. Ep. I. 18. 53 scir qua
clamare coronae proelia sustineas
campestria.

2. Vatiniana: the adjective is
here equivalent to an objective
genitive, while in 14. 3 it is sub·
jective.
