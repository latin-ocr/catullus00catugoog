and in certain MSS. as well as hy
earlier editors are called Epithala-
mia. 61 is written in honor of the
marriage of Manlius Torquatus and
Vinia Aurunculeia (cf. v. 16 n.), but
isin no sense a true epithalamium,
sung by a chorus outside the mar·
riage chamber. The poet himself,
on the contrary, speaks throughout,
acting as a sort of choragus, and,
yielding fully to the joyous enthusi-
asm of the occasion, in a tone of
purest inspiration joins in each part
of the ceremonial. The poem is,

forth for the procession to the house
of the bridegroom.

times known as the seat of the
Muses (cf. Hes. Tite. 1 Μουσάων
