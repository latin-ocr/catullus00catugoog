lations from Callimachus but declaring from-that time open

war, while the second asserts that Gellius had broken the bond
of friendship with Catullus by becoming a lover of Lesbia. In
c. 80. 1 the youth of Gellius is indicated, and in all the series
except c. 116 he is charged with various abhorrent crimes. The
most acceptable suggestion of his identity was originally made
by Pantagathus (†1578), who judged him to be that son of L.
Gellius Publicola (consul 72 sc.) who is said by Valerius
Maximus (V. 9. ι) to have been accused before the senate of
in nouercam (cf. c. 88. 1, etc.) commissum stuprum et purn'ci-
dium cogitatum. This younger Gellius was himself consul in
36 nc, and his age therefore also accords with the intimations
of Catullus. The patruus of c. 74 is identified by some critics
with the Gellius Publicola attached by Cicero in Pro Sestio 51.
110, while yet others have supposed, but with no sufficient rea-
son, that this Gellius, and not theone of Valerius Maximus, is
the Gellius assailed by Catullus.

73. The attacks of Catullus upon Mamurra have already
been mentioned (ξ 38). That he is identical with the ‘Men-
tula’ of cc. 94, 105, 114, and 115 we may be tolerably certain
on noting the use of that name for Mamurra in c. 29. 13, aud on
comparing the wealth and extravagauce of the two men (cc.
114 and 115 with cc. 29, 41, and 43), their literary pret'en·
sions (c. 105 with c. 57. 7), and their licentiousness (cc. 94 and
115. 7-8 with cc. ²9· 7-8 and 57). These latter indications,
however, but support that of c. 29. 13, and would not inde-
pendently establish the identity.

74. A sufficient biography of Mamurra is given by Pliny
(N. H. XXXVI. 6. 48), who says he was an eques of Formiae
and praefectus fabrum of Caesar in Gaul, and quotes Nepos as
authority for the statement that Mamurra first of the Romans
incrusted the entire walls of his house on the Caelian with mar·
ble, and had within it none but solid marble columns. Cicer0‚
too, mentions Mamurra's ill-gotten wealth (Au. VII. 7. 6), and
ln Aut. XIII. 5²· r (written in 45 nol refers to the cahm wax
