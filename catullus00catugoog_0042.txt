died before 1330), celebrated in a few enigmatic verses (cf.
Critical Appendix ad fin.) the rediscovery of the text of Catul-
lus ‘under a bushel,’ apparently at Verona. From this MS,
or from copies of it, numerous Italian scholars, among them
Petrarch, early learned to know the poet. The original MS.
soon disappeared, and has never been found3 but two descend·

ants of it, apparently not more than one generation removed, Α

are preserved to us, and form the basis of the present text of
Catullus. One of these copies, ordinarily called G (now No.
14,137 in the National Library at Paris) was made in the year
1375, and the other, 0 (N0. 30 of the Canonici Latin MSS. in
the Bodleian Library) at about the same time. (Cf. also intro·
ductory note to Critical Appendix.)

54. The earlier editions of Catullus, however, were based
upon interpolated MSS, and though displaying great erudition
and classieal taste left much to be desired in the way of true
principles of textual criticism. The edition of Karl Lachmann
(Berlin, 1829) first established the text of Catullus upon a
scientific basia, though the two MSS. on which he mainly
depended, D and L (in the Royal Library at Berlin), are lar
inferior to G and 0. These became first known to the world,
G in 1830 through I. Sillig (Jahrb. fiir Pltr'lol. xiii. p. 262 ft),
and Othrough Robinson Ellis in his first edition of Catullus
(Oxford, 1867). During the last quarter of a century, then,
the constitution as well as the elucidation of the text of Catullus
has made its most marked advances.

55. A few of the persons distinguished by the love or by the
hatred of Catullus may conveniently be mentioned here. Some
such persons, however, as Caesar, Cicero, and Clodius, are so
well known otherwise to the ordinary reader as to need no
biographical notice ina work of this sort. Others, like Lesbia,
have been sufficiently notieed in previous paragraphs of this
Introduction. Still others are of so little present importunae,
