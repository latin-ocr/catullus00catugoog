CATULLUS.

5 Deuoluit ili acuto sibi pondera silice.
Itaque ut relicta sensit sibi membra sine uir0,
Etiam recente terrae sola sanguine maculans
Niueis citata cepit manibus leue typanum,
Typanum, tubam Cybelles, tua, mater, initia,

gae, 72 nemariuagas), and the repe·
tition of words of agitated move·
ment and feeling (ag. rapidus three
times, citatus four times, citus twice,
rabidus three times, rabies once).

. 1. celeri: indicating his eager·
ness for arrival.

2. Phrygium nemusrthatcloth-
ing the slopes not of Dindymus but
of Ida (cf. vv. 30, 52).—citato
cupide pede: emphasizing the
eager haste of the traveller, rather
than indicating a land journey after
reaching the shores of Asia (cf. vv.
47, 89); the poet is not writing as
a geographer. Cf. v. 30 properante
pede.

„a ‘attractatam tal
trasted with the silent mysteries of
the abode of the goddess.

4. ibi, thereupon,· cf. vv. 42, 48,
763 and 66. 33; 8. 6 n.·-furenti
rabie: ct'. v. 38 rabidus furor.—
uagus animis: the plural to indi-
cate his divided‚ distorted emotions3
cf. Verg. Aen. VIII. 228 eccesurens
animis aderat Tirynthius.

5. ilit genitive from the stem
illa, a rare but legitimate variant
for the more frequent ili·; cf.
Cels. IV. 1 iliis (dat. plur.) ; Gloss.
Labb. ilium λαγών; Marc. Emp.
36 [ilium]

6. sine uiro: ie. sine uirilitate.

7. terrae sola (plural, as in v. 40
sala dura): cf. Lucr. II. 592 nam
multis succensa lacis ardent sala
terrae.

8. niueis manibus: cf. v. 10 n.
teneris degitis. Adjectives descrip-
tive of feminine beauty are employed

to accord with the change of gender
under which Attis is now spoken of,
and himself speaks of his compan-

ions (vv. 12 Gallae, 15 exsecutae, 34 ,

rapidae Gallae); cf. Hor. Carra. II.
4. 3 niuea calare (of Briseis) ; III.
27. 25 niueum latus (of Europe);
Verg. Aen. VIII. 387 niueis lacertis
(of Venus). - citata: Attis is from
henceforth a nella muller (v. 27),
and is described by feminine adjec-
tives; cf. vv. 11 adorta, tremebunda,
31 furibunda, 32 cantitata, etc.;
but when he returns to himself and
thinks with sorrow and loathing
upon his condition, the masculine
adjective is resumed; cf. vv. 51
miser, 78 leuna, 88 tenerum, 89 ille.
The emendations by which all these
later masculines (except v. 78 luere)
have been transformed to feminines
are based on incorrect feeling. -
leue: the tympanum is probably
called leue because it is cauum (v.
10).— typanum: Gr. poet. form
τύπανον, metri gralia (cf.v. 21, etc.
praeponam, Gr. auraretur) ; from
representations in vase· and wall·
paintings, an instrument like the
modern tambourine, but with the
rattling disks of metal suspended at
intervals from its edge by short
cords.

9. tubam Cybelles: as theblare
of the tuba is the summons and in·
citement to warriors, so is the beat
of the lympanum to the votaries
of Cybele ; the phrase is further
explained by tua initia. The
famous norm of Bentley (on Lu·
can Ι. 600) that when the penult is
short the form Cybele should be
