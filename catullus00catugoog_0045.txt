and was born May 28, 82 ne. (ci. Plio. l.c.). He died in, or
not very long· before, the year'47 ne. (ci. Cic. Fam. XV. ar,
4). He was renowned as a most able and skillul orator,
though oi low stature (cf. 53. 53 Sen. Contr. VII. 4. 7; Ov.
Tn‘st. II. 431), and as a writer of epie, lyric, and epigram (cs.
Cic. Brut. 279, 2835 Tac. Dial. 18 3 Quint. Inst. X. 1. 1153
Plin. Ep. Ι. 16.5 3 Gell. XIX. 9. 73 Serv. on Verg. Ecl. 6. 473

larity oi their political principles (cs. Suet. lul. 73) ,and os
their writings they are often named together (cf. with above
Hor. Sat. I. ιο. 19, and indexes to Propertius and Ovid).
The few extant fragments os his works are appended to the
editions of Catullus by Lachmann and L. Miiller. The death oi

appeal of c. 38 was a poet (cf. vv. 7 and 8), and-is doubtless
to be identified with the Cornificius mentioned by Ovid (Trist.
II. 436) in connection with other verse-writers os the periodos
Catullus. It is not so clear, though quite possible, that he is
the Q. Cornificius to whom Cicero wrote friendly letters (Fam.
XII. 17—30), dated between 45 and 43 ne. This Cornificius
was an active officer of Julius Caesar, a member oi the col-
lege os augurs, and later governor ol the province of Africa,
which he endeavored to hold agaInst T. Sextius, the general
of the second triumvirate. His death is mentioned by Jerome
under date ol 41 B.c.: Cornificius poeta a militibus desertus

this be the friend of Catullus, he may perhaps be counted as
another ol the group ol young writers won over by Caesar from
the ranks of his political soes. His interest and activity in
rhetorical studies are distinctly indicated by Cicero, and there
seems to be no good reason to doubt that he is the Cornificius
rhetor not infrequently quoted by Quintilian. With but slightly
