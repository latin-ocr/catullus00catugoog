Transpadanes at Rome, - some of them making great names
for themselves in the literary world. With some of these cer-
tainly a man of station prominent enough in Verona to be
later, at least, the friend of Julius Caesar, might command

interest. Under the charge of one of them he might have Α

placed so promising a young man as his son doubtless was.
To which one the trust fell cannot now be determined, but as
Catullus later (c. ι) ¹addresses Cornelius Nepos as the friend
and foster-father of his earlier poems, it seems not unlikely
that to his guardianship (cf. ἕ 63) Catullus owed his introduc-
tion into the society of Rome.

13. The purpose of his coming thither is nowhere stated,
but may easily be divined. Rome was the school of Italy, at
least to all who could pay for her tuition. And a youth with a
poet’s soul buming within him could hardly have been content
with such schooling as a Transpadane town afforded, even to
her wealthiest inhabitants. But whether Catullus did much ¹
studying of a serious sort may well be doubted. It cannot be
quite true that his ‘only books were woman’s looks' for his
poems show an ardent and sympathetic study of the Greek
poets. But his attainments in rhetoric and philosophy, if he
had any at all, were certainly not of a scholastic character, and
he apparently never cared to follow the students of the day to
Athens or to Rhodes

14. Not books, but lise, exercised over him the preeminent
chann. And this life was not the life os the past, but of the
present,- the busy, delirious whirl of life in the capital of the
world. Into it he plunged with all the ardor of a lively and
passionate nature. Rome was from that first moment his
, home, the centre of all his beloved activities. Verona, his
Sabine villa, and even Sirmi0, became to him but hospitals
or vacatiori haunts Once only did he leave Italy, and even
his joy at reaching Sirmio again on his return (c. 31) could

not· long detain him from Rome. hnd at Rome death met
him. ·
