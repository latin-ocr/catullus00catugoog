CATULLUS.

'15 Sed tamen in tantis maeroribus, Ortale, mitto
Haec expressa tibi carmina Battiadae,
Ne tua dicta uagis nequiquam credita uentis
Effluxisse meo forte putes animo,
Vt missum sponsi furtiuo munere malum
20 Procurrit casto uirginis e gremi0,
Quod miserae oblitae molli sub ueste locatum,
Dum aduentu matris prosilit, excutitur;
Atque illud prono praeceps agitur decursu,
Huic manat tristi conscius ore rubor.

15. sed tamen: after the long
parenthesis the poet returns to his
theme, sed, as often, being resump-
tive.

16. haec: probably c. 66 is re·
serred to.-expressa, translated,·
cf. Ter. Ad. 11 uerbum de uerbo ex·
pressum extulit. - Battiadae: Cal·
limachus, the famous Alexandrian
scholar and poet at the court oi
Ptolemy Philadelphus, was the son
of a certain Battus of Cyrene, and
claimed descent from the founder
of that city; cf. 7. 4, 6 n.; 116. 2.

17. eredita uentis: with the fig·
mmmmm

19. ut, ete: the comparison is os
the irrevocable swiltness with which
the apple falls and the reminders
vanish.-missummunere:cs.ror.
8 tradita munera-sponsi: the
secrecy of the gift, and the confu-
sion οἵ the maiden at its discovery,
show that a secret lover is meant.
-malumz apples were prover·
bially the giits ot lovers; cl. the
Callimachean story of Cydippe3
Theocr. 3. 10, et al.,· Verg. Ecl.
3. 71 aurea ntalu decem misi ,· 64
nealo me Galatea petia· Prop. l. 3.
24 nuncsurliua cauis poma dabam
neanibus,· Petron. Frag. 33. 1 Biich.
astrea mala mihi, duleis mea Mar-
cia mittis. Cf. also the story of

Atalanta, and the explanation of the
aureolum malum (212) by the
quotationsiromVergilandPetronius.

20. procurrit, etc.: Festus (p.
165) refers to a proverb based
on such accidents— casto: the
girl is not os loose character, but
a carefully trained daughter who
has not learned how not to blush.
-gremioz ¹the girdle around the
body just below the breasts made
the upper part of the robe a con-
venient, if not saie, receptaele for
small objects.

21. miserae oblitae: with this
use of the adjective instead of the
adverb misere with another adjec-
tive cf. 64. 57.—molli carries still
further the general impression oi
gentle innocence conveyed by casto,
and thus emphasizes the painful
blush ol her embarrassment.

22. prosilit: the girl rises re·
spectfully as her mother enters, but
hastily, because she is surprised
while dreaming ol her lover, and is
at first oblivious oi other matters;
thus her sudden movement dis·
lodges the apple.

23. The spondaic verse well ex·
presses the girl’s dismay, which
makes even the swilt lall of the
apple seem to occupy a life-time.

24. huic: contrasted with v. 23
