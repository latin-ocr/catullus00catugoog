CRITICAL APPENDIX. 227

Codex T huoneus (T), which is of great inrportance for the text ol e. 62,

is now No. 8,071 ol the Latin MSS. in the National Library in Paris. It ⁹

is a book oi 61 leaves, each measuring 29 by 20. 5 centimeters, aud is
written in a Carolingian haud of the ninth century. It contains the writ-
iugs ol Juvenal, and ol Eugenius of Toledo, together with extraets from
Martial, the 62nd poem of Catullus, and a Latin Anthology. A helio-
graphia facsimile of fol. 51, containing some epigrams of Martial and
62. 1-22 os Catullus, forms plate XIV. ol the Poliogrophie des Classiques
Lotins os M. Chatelain, and a less accurate reproduetion of the same verses
ol Catullus was published by Mr. Ellis in his second edition.

Orthographieal peculiarities, as such, are noted in this Appendix only
when they occur in proper names, or are otherwise of especial interest.

Italics are used iu the variant readings to designate all letters that are
written in the MSS. in abbreviation or ligature. Where variant readings
are given in the MSS. themselves, not written as a part of the text, but
either between the verses or in the margin, they are enclosed in parentheses.

Odenotes codex Oxoniensis. ’

G denotes codex Sangermanensis.

T denotes codex T huoneus.

V (codex Veronensis) denotes the common reading ol 0 and G. Where
the reading of but one of these MSS. is given, the reading of the other is
that adopted in the text.

The letter ω is often used to designate such readings as occur in at least
several ol the interpolated MSS. or of the earliest (Italian) editions of
Catullus. Where the source of a reading adopted in the text is not other-
wise noted, it is understood to be due to ω. In ascribing emendations to
individual sources the names ol scholars ol the present century are usually
given in the vernacular; those of scholars ol preceding centuries, with a
few more familiar exceptions, in the Latin form.
