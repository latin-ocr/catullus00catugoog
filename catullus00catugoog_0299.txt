226 CRlTlCAL APPENDIX.

the first and second pages, and again on fol. 21 r., on the opening verses
of c. 64.

In a pocket inside the back cover of the book are five sheets of note·
paper of four pages each containing variant readings, and headed Varie
lectiones cod· ms· catulli memb· in β sec· XIV· apud Ab· Canonici cnm
edit· Aldina 1502 collati. Just below and to the right on the same page
is written, apparently by the same hand, but at a later date, coeperam in
gratiam Laurentii Santenii, sednon absolui, neque ei misi quicquam.
The first of these readings is arida arada . . (1. 2), and the la'st (appar-
ently) sanna esset nunc quod gannit. . (83. 4).

A lacsimile of fol. 26 u.(64. 336-366) by the collotype process is given
in the edition of Catullus by Robinson Ellis (Oxford, 1878²); faesimiles of
fot. 13r. (50· 3-51. 12) and fol. 2011. (63. 57-87) were published by Mr.
Ellis in his XII. Facsimiles fram Latin MSS. in the Bodleian Library
(1885); a reduced faesimile of fol. 21 r. follows the preface to this volume,
and since it has passed through the press a faesimile of the same page by
the heliographic process has come to hand as plate XV.A in the Palea
graphia des Classiques Latias of M. Chatelain (Paris, 1892).

Codex Sangermanensis (G), now No. 14,137 oi the Latin MSS. in the
National Library in Paris, formerly No. r,165 in the library of the abbey
of St.·Germain·des·Pres. Its subscription shows it to have been written in
the year 13753 and even is the words et cetera there occurring are taken
as an indication that its scribe was but copying stom a longer subscription of
the year 1375, the style os the writing shows that this copy could not have
been made much later than that date. The book contains the works ol
Catullus only, and is described by Schwabe as consisting of 36 leaves of
parchment, each 243 centimeters long and 16.9 centimeters wide, with 33
lines ol writing on a page. The last page, however, contains 34 lines.
The text presents many erasures and corrections, the very large majority of
which, at any rate, were made either by the original copyist, or by another
not far removed from him in time. The copyist of G seems to have been
somewhat more sophisticated than the copyist of 0, and (as the subscrip·
tion also intimates) to have been more worried about the condition os the
text he was reproducing. The result is that the more ignorant blunders
committed or perpetuated in O are often the better guide to the readings
of the common original of the two MSS. A heliographic faesimile of two
adjoining pages of G, fol. 35 u. and 361. (110. 7-116. 8), forms plate XV.
in the Pale'agraplzie des Classiqnes Latias of M. Chatelain, and the entire

MS. has recently been reproduced in excellent faesimile by a photolitho-
graphie process (Paris, Leroux, 1890).
