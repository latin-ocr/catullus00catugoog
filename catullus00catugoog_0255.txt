CATULLUS.

. [68··34-

Hoc fit quod Romae uiuimus: illa domus,
35 Illa mihi sedes, illic mea carpitur aetas ;
Huc una ex multis capsula me sequitur.
Quod eum ita sit, nolim statuas nos mente maligna
Id facere aut animo non satis ingenuo
Quod tibi non utriusque petenti copia parta est:
40 Vltro ego deferrem, eopia si qua foret.

681‘.

Non possum reticere, deae, qua me Allius in re
querit aut quantis iuuerit officiis
Ne fugiens saeclis obliuiscentibus aetas

109 sit bona librorum copia,¹ Ov.
Trist. ΙΙΙ, 14. 37 non hic librorum
copia.

36. capsula: te. scrinium.

37. mente maligna, etc, in
gruaging temper or ungrocious
spirit.

39. non: modifying the entire
expression, though placed before
the pronoun, as frequently in Catul-
lus. Riese gives a full list of such
phrases. — utriusque: i.e. of verses
composed especially for you at this
time, and also of earlier verses.

40. ultro ego deferrem, ete:
Catullus had apparently known of
the sorrow of Manlius before his
letter carne, but because of his own
grief had taken no notice of it till
personally appealed to.

(38¹². Α panegyric on allius for
his assistance in furthering the
poet's affair with Lesbia, into char·
acterization of whose love as lihe
that of Laodamia the poem straight-
way glides, to be recalletl to Allius
once more only with v. 149.-The
Allius addressed is otherwise un-
known, though the name is found
not infrequently in inscriptions3 he
must, however, have been a man

of some position in Rome for
Clodia’s visits to his house (v. 68)
not to arouse question. -The invo
lution of theme, with the introduc·
tion of the Laodamia episode, itself
interrupted by the lament over the
death of the poet’s brother, is
thoroughly Alexandrian. —See also
introductory note to c. 68⁸.

41. non possum reticere: the
earnestness of the poet's feeling is
well expressed by the abruptness of
the opening, carried out by the
emphatic repetition of iuuerit.-
deae: the poem opens, in epic style,
withan address to the Muses; cf.
Theocr. 17 (the panegyrie upon
Ptolemy).

43. ne, etc: it gives an easier
passage of thought to v. 45 sed
dicam to take vv. 43 and 44 asa
final clause directly dependent upon
non possum reticere, rather than
to read with the MSS. nec and under-
stand the clause as a parenthetical
wish (for a potential subjunctive
here seems impossible). With MS.
nec for a genuine ne ef. v. 103; 21.
1s; 62· 59³ 99· 9· -fugiens...
aetas, theflzght os time through ages
