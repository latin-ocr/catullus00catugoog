168 CATULLUS.

At tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile,
Sed fratris cari flebile discidium?
Quam penitus maestas exedit cura medullas!
Vt tibi tunc toto pectore sollicitae
25 Sensibus ereptis mens excidit ! at te ego certe
Cognoram a parua uirgine magnanimum.
Anne bonum oblita es facinus quo regium adepta es
Coniugium, quod non fortior ausit alis?
Sed tum maesta uirum mittens quae uerba locuta es!
30 Iuppiter, ut tristi lumina saepe manu l

in the sense of active participation
inan affair.

21. at: introducing a possible
protest of Berenice against the
charge of inconsistency. — luxti:
for luxisti ,· see 14. 1411. misti.

22. fratris: Berenice was the
first cousin of Ptolemy (111.) Euer-
getes, both being grandchildren on
the father's side of Ptolemy Ι. But
frater may be used here, like the
Gr. ἀδελφός, of this relationship (cf.
111. 4n.); or, more likely, it repre-
sents the way in which Ptolemy and
Berenice were usually spoken of ; for
the custom in the Egyptian royal
house of marriage between brother
and sister is well known ; cf. the de·
cree of Canopus l. 7 βασιλεὺς Πτολε-
μαῖος . . . καὶ βασίλισσα Βερενίκηὴ
ἀδελφὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ γυνή θεοὶ εὐεργέται.

23. quam, etc. : beginning the tri·
umphant rejoinder to the protest in
vv. 21 and 22 ; sisters show no such
extremity of grief over separation
from brothers. -penitus exedit
medullas: cf. 35. 15 n.; Verg.

says that Berenice (whom he calls
the daughter of Ptolemy Phila-
delphus) 0nce saved her father's
life by mounting a horse and rally·
ing his wavering troops. But this
would not have won her husband.
The reference is doubtless to the
story told by Justin (XXVI. 3) that
Berenice’s mother was opposed to
her betrothal to Ptolemy, and de·
sired to marry her rather to Deme·
ttius, brother of Antigonus, king of
Macedonia. Demetrius, however,
formed a criminal connection with
the mother, and was assassinated
by a hand of conspirators, at whose
head stood Berenice, who thereby
was enabled to fulfil her former
engagement.

28. coniugium = maritum ,· cf.
68. 1073 Tac. Ann. 11. 13. 3 mam'·
monia ac pecunias hostium praedae
destinarc.-quod . . . alis: i.e. a
deed which none other would dare,
and prove himself thereby the brav-
er. Ellis compares Hor. Carm.111. ’
23. 18 non sumptuosa blandior fros·

Aen. IV. 66 est mollis stamma me- tia molliuit auersos Penates—alis:
dullas. cf. 29. 15 n. alid.

25. sensibus ereptis: cf. 51· 5 29. turn: directing the thought
misere quod onznis eripit sensus once more to the later period and
mihi. greater fear. —mittensz cf. 96.

27 f. Hyginus (Poel. Astr. ΙΙ. 24), 4 n. missas.
evidently referring to this passage, 30.1uppiter: cf. r. 7 n.-
