el. Hlarus in thesis is found incc.66.11nonoanctus; 68.
158 petato onem'a; 107. 1 capello optanti. In cc. 27. 4, 66. 48,
and 97. 2, it occurs in the Mss, but not in the emended text
here presented. Hiatus in arsis occurs in ec. 10. 27 mane
itaquae 55. 4 te t'a,· 97. 1 di amcam 114. 6 domo epse.

e. Svsrorm of finale is not uncommon, especially in verbs.
In 10. 26 commoda (imperative) occurs.

fi Drasroim occurs in ec. 64. 360 tepisacret, and 90. 6 liqui·
sacr'ens (but cf. 68. ²9 tepefactet).

g. ln c. 116. 8 dabir final s does not make position with the
initial consonant following 3 and in c. 23. ²7 the reading of V,
satzi· beatas, is probably correct, representing sotis beata’s (tle.
beatas es). In cc. 62. 4, 64. 2ο, and 66. 11 afinal syllable
ending in a single consonant is lengthened in thesis before
hymenaeus. Afinal syllable ending in a short vowel is thrice
lengthened in thesis before a mute followed by r (in cc. 4. 9
Propontida tracen· 4. 18 impotentia seeta; 29. 4 ultima
Bea'tannr'a); and it is noticeable that all these instances occur
in pure (Ρ) iambics. A similar syllable is lengthened in thesis
before initials followed by a consonant in ec. 17. 24 pote
stolr'drnn,· 22. 12 otrodo scurra,· 44. 18 nefaria scapra- 63. 53
gelida stabulae 64. 186 nulla spes,· 67. praepoposito speculae.
But Catullus is not careful to follow ont this mle of position in
all cases, any more than he is consistent in instances of systole
and diastole, or in such cases as ec. 43. 2 niger‘s, but 68. 63
nigro· and especially 71. 2 podagra, bnt 71. 6 podagro. In
these minor matters he allows himself greater freedom than
either Lucretius or the later poets, and the same liberty is
seen in the greater matters concerned with his treatment of
metres llis graceful command of rhythm was far removed
from the fixed formalities adopted by the Augarstans.
