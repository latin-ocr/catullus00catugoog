. CATULLUS.

Quare, quod scribis Veronae turpe Catullo
Esse quod hic quisquis de meliore nota

Frigida deserto tepefactet

membra cubili,

30 Id, Manli, non est turpe, magis miserum est.
Ignosces igitur, si, quae mihi luctus ademit,
Haec tibi non tribuo munera, cum nequeo. .
Nam quod scriptorum non magna est copia apud me,

etc. With delicias cf. 45. 24. n; 74.
2; with the otiose genitive animi,
2.10 animi curas,· 64. 372 animi
amores ,· 102. 2 fides animi.

27-30. Τὴε reference to love-
affairs in v. 261eads Catullus to the
second part of the letter of Manlius,
wherein the writer, desiring the per·
sonal presence and sympathy of
Catullus, and not knowing any
reason for his long tarrying in
Verona, endeavored to draw him
thence by a waming (though using ’
no names) that his duty to himself
in the protection of his honor sum·
moned him back to Rome; Catul-
lus replies that his grief makes it
impossible for even such consider·
ations to move him.

27. Veronae turpe Catullo
esse: apparently the predicate in·
finitive esse is (though contrary to

28. hic: at the place where
Manlius was writing‚ the word be·
ing quoted directly from his letter:
there is no reason for believing the
place to be' other than Rome.—
quisquis: apparently the masculine
is here used absolutely (without
est) after analogy of established use
of the neuter in that way. — de
meliore nota, of tle heller sort,· cf.
Cic. Fam. Vll. 29. 1 Sulpicii succes·
sori no's de utiliore nola continenda.
Clodia's lovers were naturally not
from the lowest orders of society.

29. frigida membra: they had
been excluded while Catullus was
on hand. —tepefaeten on the
quantity cf. 64. 360 n. tepefaciet;
the word is ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.

30. magis: in a sense approach-
ing that of the French nzais,· cf.
Sall. lug. 85. 49 neque quisquam

general usage) omitted here, or else parens liberis uti aeterni soreul,

(and most improbably) the later esse
serves as both subject and predicate ;

optauit, magis uti boui honestique
uitam exigerent—miserum, piti-

for in spite of v. 28 lric and the MS. sul,· cf. 91. 2; 99. 153 Cic. Fin. V.

Catulle, a direct quotation in such
a setting would be extremely rare.
The meaning evidently is, ‘to be
staying at Verona is dishonorable
for Catullus, when his place with
Lesbia is being filled by promiscu-
,ous lovers' The reply is, ‘the mat-
ter is not one of dishonor but of

84 bouum liberi, misera orbitas.

and explains why he cannot send
poems earlier composed,—he has
none with him, or none that would
be new and pleasing to Manlius.
The lack of logical order, with the

sorrow.'—0atulloz the poet likes prosaic sentence-openings in vv. 1,
to refer to himself in the third per· 27, 33, and prosaic expression else·
