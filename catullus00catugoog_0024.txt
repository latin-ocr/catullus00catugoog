laintness that seizes upon him even while he feels himself a
god, and more than a god, in sharing her smile and her voice.
And with the swiit passion comes the mad desire to win her
love. Lesbia is a married woman (c. 83. ι), but that consider-
ation demands only additional care aud diplomacy ou his part,
and is no barto his efforts. He lays siege to her heart. His
importunate persistence, youth as he is, commands her attention
even amid a throug oi lovers, but apparently only irritates her.
What does this youngster, lately come to Rome, hope sor amid
so many os his betters? He'sees that victory must be won over
this brilliant woman os the world by proving himself no mere

of her pet (c. 3), flow from his pen with a perfect lreedom ol
movement and yet with an exquisite grace and perfection in
every part. And the mere thought that any proud damsel could
once claim comparison with his Lesbia rouses him to hot scorn
(ca 43, 8⁶)-

attractive to Lesbia, hut it could not take the piace oi ab other
