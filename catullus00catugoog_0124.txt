CATULLUS.

37·

Salax taberna uosque contubernales
A pilleatis nona fratribus pila,
Solis putatis esse mentulas uobis,
Solis licere quidquid est puellarum

5 Confutuere et putare ceteros hircos?
An, continenter quod sedetis insulsi
Centum an ducenti, non putatis ausurum
Me una ducentos irrumare sessores?
Atqui putate: namque totius uobis

10 Frontem tabernae sopionibus scribam.
