INTRODUCFION. XXXV

rhythms. Then follows the group of longer poems (44. 61-
681), introduced by the three epithalamia (cc. 61, 62, 64), with ’
their Eros accompanied by the Anteros 014. 633 this group ol
poems begins with glyconics (4. 61), continues with dactylic
hexameters (44. 62, 64), divided by passionate galliambics (c.
63), and concludes with elegiacs (cc. 65-681). It is followed
by a third group of shorter poems (cc. 69-116), all in the
elegiae metre, but as varied in theme as the first group. This
division was suggested entirely by the metres and length of the
poems, and not at all by their subject-matter 3 for the third
group contains poems agrceing in subject and date with others
in the first group (cf. ag. c. 99 with c. 48, c. 81 with 4. 24, 4. 93
with 44. 29 and 57). Within each group pocms on the same or
similar themes occasionally stand together (ag. 44. 2 and 33 cc. ι
61 and 62; 44. 88-91, 44. 110 and 111), but more frequently
are divided by one or more poems on another, and often a
contrasted theme (cf. cc.5 and 7, 44. 21 and ²3 , 44. 62 and
64, 44. 69 and 71, 44. 70 and 72).

49. The editor certainly included one mere fragment (c.
581), and perhaps more ο1 the poems whose condition we
attribute to the neglect of a later age (ag. cc. 2. 11-133 141,
54, 781) may have been published by him in their present
form, on account of his anxiety to omit no serap found among
his friend’s posthumous papers.

50. Another possibility suggests itself. The editor certainly
must have disregarded what would have been the wishes of
Catullus in publishing, or republishing, the poems against Caesar,
especially if none had yet been written in his lavor. The edi-
tor was doubtless one of the circle of literary friends of the
poet at Rome, and so waS, if not, like Catullus,a subject of
sudden conversion, an anti-Caesarian. Is it possible that he
still further used his discretion, and served his own sympathies,
by refraining from the 'publication of later poems favorable to
Caesar, and that by this theory, and not by that of the speedy
death of the poet, we are to explain the absence 'inhiswodm
