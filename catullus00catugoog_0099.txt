CATULLUS.

[22. 18-

Nimirum idem omnes fallimur, neque est quisquam
Quem non in aliqua re uidere Suffenum

20 Possis. Suus cuique attributus est error,
Sed non uidemus manticae quod-in tergo est.

Furi, cui neque seruus est neque arca
N ec cimex neque araneus neque igniS, ’
Verum est et pater et nouerca, quorum

ridentur molo qui componunt car-

bankrupt, as were many ol the

ruina ,· uerum gaudent scribentes et young men about town at that day,

se uenerantur.

18 ff. Catullus falls here into an
unusually reflective vein, quite in
the style of Horace.

date commemorated in 11. With
the first verses cf. Mart. XI. 32· 1-4

sage, Aesopus tradit homines duos
manticas babere, unam ante se,
alterans retro: in priorem aliena

Hoc Catullus rneminit. To this Per-

temptat descendere, eremo, sed proece-

23· An epigram os coarse irony
on the poverty os Furius, with
whom, as with Aurelius, Catullus
was now on no friendly terms, since
they had disregarded his injunctions
concerning Juventius (see Intr.
37, 41). Perhaps the immediate
inspiration to this poem came from
the fact that Furius, being utterly

trullo est ancillo nec insons, nec

1. neque seruus: ci. ²4· 5.
Even a poor man could own a
slave, as, for instance, Horace, who,
when representing the extreme sim-
plicity oi his life, yet speaks of his
dinner as served by three slaves
(Sat. Ι. 6. 116).-neque arca: lor
Furius has no money to keep in it.

2. nec cimex: forthere is not a
bed to conceal one-neque ara-
neus: forthere is not a roos under

neque ignis : sor there is no hearth

trasting adversation; the things
Furius has are precisely those most
