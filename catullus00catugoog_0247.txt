CATULLUS.

Sed potius largis adfice muneribus.
Sidera cur retinent? utinam coma regia fiam:
Proximus Hydrochoi fulgeret Oarion.

constellation, called by the Romans
Aquarius, extends over a space
from 900 to 1400 distant from Ori-

ante-classical and poetical variant
for fulgere. The imperfect subjunc-

Ὠαρίων.

of a conversation between the poet
and the door of a certain house,
abounds in difficulties of interpreta-

notes): The Door is that of a
house in Verona (v. 34), formerly
owned by an aged (v. 4) bachelor
or widower (v. 6) named Balbus,
after whose death (v. 6) it ‚came
into the possession of his son (v. 1)
Caecilius, who thereupon married
(v. 6) and brought home a young
and lively widow (v. 20) from Brixia
(v. 32), who claimed to be also a
maid (v. 19). Strange rumors
about her life soon began to spread
through Verona, and the poet in·
quires of the Door why it has
betrayed its master’s confidence
(presumably by letting in lovers to
narravera-,am
not betrayed its trust, but the
woman was a bad lot before she
came to Verona, and the current
gossip is true of the period of her
former marriage; for though her
husband was notoriously impotent,
his father stepped in to fill the
son's place in the household, and
the woman moreover was too in·
timate with certain other people

tion for us, though its directness of named and hinted at. The proof

personal reference must have made
it clear enough to the Veronese.

of this culpability is found not only
in rumors that have followed her
