CATULLUS.

66.

Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,
Qui stellarum ortus comperit atque obitus,
Flammeus ut rapidi solis nitor obscuretur,
Vt cedant certis sidera temporibus,
5 Vt Triuiam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans

illud; the eye turns from the tell·
tale apple to the tell-tale face of the
maiden.

66. This translation of the Βερε-
νίκης Πλόκαμος of Callimachus, a
few fragments of which are extant,
is quite possibly the poem sent to
Hortensius with c. 65. lt is complex
and artificial‚ and, indeed, if the
translation was made when Catullus
was burdened with grief for the
loss of his brother, it is not strange
that his native genius shows so
little through it. Whether the ob-
scurity of some passages in it is
due to lack of care on the part
of the translator, or to an excessive

fidelity to the original, cannot be·

determined; but the general char-
acteristica of Alexandrian poetry
would lead us to refer the fault to
Callimachus himself. The theme,
acompound of court tradition and
of astronomical knowledge, is as
follows: Berenice, daughter of Ma-
gas, king of Cyrene, and wife of
her cousin Ptolemy Euergetes
(reigned 247-222 ne), king of
Egypt, had for her husband’s safety
vowed to the gods a lock of her
hair, when, shortly after his acces-
sion to the throne and marriage,
the king was setting out on an
{titillettlllt &translat
and the tress deposited in the tem·
ple of the deified Arsinoe on the
promontory of Zephyrion. Next
morning, however, it had disap-
peared3 but the anger of the king

was appeased by the court astron·
omer, Conon, who said that he
had descried it among the stars,
where it must have been placed
by divine agency. To verify his
words Conon pointed out the hith-
erto undistinguished minor constel-
lation which is now known as Coma
Berenices. Date, about 59 B.c. (cf.
introductory note to c. 65).

1. omnia qui: the antecedent
clause begins in v. 7.—dispexit‚
descried,· as distinguishing in the
darkness, or amid the multitude of
other stara—mundi, the firma·
ment,· as in 64. 2063 but witha
different meaning in 47. 2.

3. rapidi, scorclring, as the words
flammeus nitor clearly indicate;
cf. Verg. Geor. Ι. 92 rapidi potentia
solis acrior,· IV. 425 rapidus tor·
renssitientisSiriuslndos.—obscu·
retur: sc. in an eclipse3 cf, Plin.
N. H. II. 47 nullum aliud sidus
eodem modo obscuretur.

4. ut cedant, ete: in v. 2 the
reference is to the apparent daily
motion of the stars, due to the revo-
lution of the earth on its axis; in
v. 4, to their yearly motion with
reference to the apparent position
of the sun, due to the revolution of
the earth about the sun,

5. Triuiam: cf. 34. 15 n.-
Latmia saxa: Selene was wont to
meet secretly upon Mt. Latmus in
Caria the beautiful shepherd En-
dymion, with whom she had fallen
in love (cf. Paus. V. 1); sub saxa
:in antrum.
