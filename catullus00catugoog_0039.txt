he does not hesitate to employ words and figures that suggest
the earlier tragedians rather than the comedians.

47. Cicero, in his later years, professed contempt for the
whole tribe of these poetae noui (like Catullus and his friends)
who had forsaken all the traditions of Ennius (Or. 161 3 Tusc.
ΙΙΙ. 453 Att.V11.2.1); and Horace mentions Catullus but
once, and then with definite disparagement (Sat. Ι. το. τ9);
but even from these references it may be fairly inferred that
the poetry of Catullus was well and acceptably known among
his immediate generation of Romam, and had not to wait till
thetime of the elegiasts for a purely posthumous fame. It
waS, indeed, not so very long after his death that Cornelius
Nepos ventured to rank him in quality alongside Lucretius
(Art. 12. 4). His fame, then, was contemporary with him-
self. But even a cursory examination of his extant book of
poems shows evidence that it was not published till after the
poet’s death. For although it has corne down to us mutilated
by the accidents of time in a most unseemly manner, no muti-
lation can account for the condition of c. 58⁶, which is clearly
but a rejected trial-sketch for the poem afterward elaborated as
c, 55, and not a misplaced part of c. 55 itself (note the much
greater frequency of dactyls in the second place in the verses of
c. 58⁶ than of c. 55). Would Catullus himself have published
such amere fragment? Still more, would he after the recon-
ciliation with Julius Caesar have published, or republished, the
poems in which Caesaris hitterly assailed? For this same reason,
if for no other, it is also impossible to suppose, with certain
eritics, that Catullus himself arranged the book for publication,
but was overtaken by death before it was actually published.

48. The only satisfactory hypothesis is that the book was

’ both arranged and published, after the author's death, by some

literary friend of his at Rome, where he ordinarily kept his
books and papers (cf. c. 68. 33-36). The posthumous editor
arranged the poems in three general groups. First come sixty
shorter poems on various themeS, all in iambic or logaoedic
